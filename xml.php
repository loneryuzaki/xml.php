Amazon will let you pay with your palm in some Whole Foods stores
</title>
<content type="html">
<figure> <img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MSyD5MejMwrHLsOapuQzK2nNIfk=/0x0:5127x3845/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67550613/Amazon_One_image.7.jpg" /> <figcaption>The Amazon One pay-by-palm technology will now be available at select Whole Foods stores. | Amazon</figcaption> </figure> <p>And, it hopes, at other retailers’ stores in the future.</p> <p id="tLSOy9">Amazon accounts for nearly 40 percent of e-commerce sales in the US today, and it takes a cut of even more online shopping by selling payments services and other technologies to external shopping sites. Now, the online retail giant is making a play to grab a piece of brick-and-mortar shopping, too — and it wants customers to literally lend a hand to do it.</p> <p id="9Dumxl">Amazon on Wednesday is unveiling a new way to pay at select Whole Foods stores: a biometric technology called Amazon One that allows shoppers to pay by placing their palm over a scanning device when they check out. The new technology is now available at the grocery chain’s Madison Broadway store in Seattle, Washington. Seven more Whole Foods locations in the Seattle area will offer the payment option in the coming months.</p> <p id="HmAZOg">The first time they register to use this tech, a customer will scan their palm and insert their payment card at a terminal; after that, they can simply pay with their hand. The hand-scanning tech isn’t just for Amazon’s own stores — the company hopes to sell it to other retailers, including competitors.</p> <p id="RY3hro">Amazon first introduced the technology in September at some of the company’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/1/21/16914188/amazon-go-grocery-convenience-store-opening-seattle-dilip-kumar">Amazon Go cashierless convenience stores</a> in Seattle. The company had added the tech to a total of 12 stores in the Seattle area before today’s Whole Foods announcement. Recode first reported in December 2019 that <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/26/21037923/amazon-go-hand-scanning-patent-biometrics-whole-foods-identity">Amazon had filed a patent application for such a hand-payment technology</a>.</p> <p id="X6X7x7">In September, Amazon executive Dilip Kumar told Recode that the company expects to sell the technology to other retailers, <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/3/9/21171473/amazon-go-cashierless-just-walk-out-technology-retailers-no-checkout">like it began doing earlier this year with its “Just Walk Out” technology</a> — the cocktail of cameras, sensors, and computer vision software that powers Amazon Go stores. Kumar said the Amazon One pitch to other retailers is straightforward: reduce friction for your customers at checkout, thereby shortening lines and increasing how many shoppers are served along the way. The company said in a blog post on Wednesday that it was in discussions with other retailers, but did not yet have any partnerships to announce.</p> <p id="hAw5AM">Amazon’s plan to license these two homegrown technologies to other retailers, whether competitor or not, is the real story: Amazon isn’t satisfied with e-commerce dominance; it wants to earn a cut of more transactions in the physical retail world, where 80-something percent of commerce still takes place in the US. So it’s building out a futuristic suite of services to court other retailers, while showcasing the technology in its own stores as case studies. </p> <p id="jtujqE">One obvious question is whether retailers, many of which consider Amazon a competitor of one sort or another, will want to do business with the tech giant. Kumar pointed to Amazon Web Services, the company’s $40 billion division that leases computing power, data storage, and myriad software capabilities to internet companies big and small, as an example of an Amazon offering that attracts competitors. </p> <p id="NJMhqH">Amazon will collect data on where Amazon One customers shop when they use the payment option, but it will not know what shoppers purchase or how much they spend inside third-party retail stores. An Amazon spokesperson said the company has “no plans to use transaction information from third-party locations for Amazon advertising or other purposes,” and shoppers can sign up for the service without linking it to an Amazon customer account if they choose.</p> <p id="91hN8k">Another question is whether enough people will be willing to hand over scans of their hands to Amazon in order to save a bit of time at checkout. It’s true that a no-touch payment method might be more attractive today, during the <a href="https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19">Covid-19</a> pandemic, than even a year ago. But new payment methods often face steep adoption challenges, and that’s even when biometrics aren’t involved. Biometric tracking poses a host of privacy concerns, including the potential of targeted hacking or a mass data breach.</p> <p id="yKpj0w">Kumar, the Amazon executive, said the more locations where Amazon can introduce the technology, the more valuable customers will find it and be willing to give it a try. That’s why the company plans to pitch other use cases beyond payments. Kumar also said Amazon is discussing with potential partners the idea of linking palm scans with building IDs to replace office ID cards, or with event tickets for stadiums or arenas.</p> <p id="58xu6d">The executive added that Amazon chose palm scans over other biometric options for a few reasons. One, he said, is that it’s not easy for a bad actor to identify a person by simply viewing an image of their hand, if that material ever leaked. Another is the uniqueness of each person’s hand. “Even identical twins have many differences in their palm structure,” he said. A spokesperson added that the images are encrypted when scanned, and then “sent to a highly secure area we custom-built in the cloud for analysis and storage.”</p> <p id="GH4atL">To some, the upside still won’t be worth it. “How lazy are people that they will hand over their handprints so they don’t have to take out their wallet?” my wife asked when I mentioned the new technology to her in an embargoed dinner-table discussion. But Apple’s Touch ID fingerprint-scanning tech and its Face ID face-scanning tech also seemed a little crazy at first — until they weren’t. </p> <p id="LGeWrz">And if enough customers trust Amazon with the trade-off, physical retailers will face an interesting dilemma: chase the future by aligning with the most powerful tech company in retail, or stick to the present and hope their customers don't stray as a result.</p> <p id="PQiMxw"><strong>Update, April 21, 2021: </strong>This article has been updated to report that Amazon plans to introduce its pay-by-hand technology in select Whole Foods stores.</p> <p id="9mGQd0"></p>

<title>The complicated relief of the Chauvin verdict </title>
<content type="html">
<figure> <img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2HmG5Hz0NKGSRsqZI6mpB61QoKI=/163x0:2830x2000/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69160593/GettyImages_1232424699.0.jpg" /> <figcaption>People celebrate as the verdict is announced in the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin outside the Hennepin County Government Center in Minneapolis on April 20. | Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption> </figure> <p>Americans cried, hugged, and gathered in the streets after jurors convicted the former police officer of murdering George Floyd. </p> <p id="LgM9WW">Relief is perhaps the best word to describe what many people felt when they heard Judge Peter Cahill announce <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/4/20/22387556/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-manslaughter">the jury’s monumental decision</a> to convict former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin of murder on Tuesday. </p> <p id="svUESa">Millions of people viewed the cellphone video of Chauvin pinning George Floyd by the neck with his knee last May. Many Americans had previously seen police bludgeon, brutalize, and kill Black people on video (the police assault of Rodney King made its way to TV in 1991), but the murder of Floyd, amid a pandemic that was already ravaging Black communities, became a breaking point in the long history of police claiming the lives of countless Black Americans. </p> <p id="1K2IJS">Months of anger and fury ensued to keep Floyd’s memory alive and prove that Floyd’s life and all others like his matter. Activists leading the charge did not let the country forget Floyd’s name and image. It took nights of being bulldozed by the police at protests and blindly believing that there could be justice before arriving at Tuesday’s conviction. </p> <p id="dCTXdH">And with the conviction came the relief seen in the faces of the Minneapolis residents who gathered at Cup Foods Tuesday evening, the site where Floyd called out for his mother and exclaimed 27 times that he couldn’t breathe. Crowds exhaled at the shock of a justice system actually functioning against a police officer and in favor of a Black man. The public outcry for Floyd that has endured for nearly a year was not in vain. </p> <aside id="KLm47E"><div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Chauvin’s conviction matters ","url":"https://www.vox.com/2021/4/20/22387556/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-manslaughter"}]}'></div></aside><p id="uIQMyu">But the emotional complexity of Tuesday’s energy lies in the fact that justice cannot be served for someone who is already dead, a hard truth that undergirds the moment. “There’s a reason why this ignited and really touched a worldwide audience,” D.A. Bullock, a member of the Minneapolis organization <a href="https://www.reclaimtheblock.org/">Reclaim the Block</a>, told Vox. “We were really confronted with our belief system about policing. We saw it with our own two eyes. I want to tell people, ‘Don’t look back on that and say that’s solved once you get rid of one officer.’ That’s not true.”</p> <p id="fLva1X">The difficulty of the jury’s verdict is compounded by the fact that Chauvin’s conviction is an aberration. Only seven officers have been charged with murder for police shootings since 2005, though an average of 1,000 police killings of civilians are reported each year. </p> <p id="ZnAwk2">The deep toll of the moment also stems from the reality that eyewitnesses like now-18-year-old Darnella Frazier and her 9-year-old cousin will bear the burden of seeing Floyd’s death firsthand for the rest of their lives. While Floyd’s relatives spoke of the victory of Chauvin’s conviction,<strong> </strong>his family is not whole. Though Chauvin will be sentenced to prison, policing in America, as racist and corrupt as it is, remains intact. This one-off conviction is part of a wicked game, bringing a moment of triumph when Black people have already lost so much.<strong> </strong>That onlookers waited at the edge of their seats, with the possibility that Chauvin could have been acquitted, speaks to the nature of the country’s faulty criminal justice system. </p> <p id="zNjH4H">Still, the jury’s decision is a moment to exhale. Across the country, people held their fists in the air, cried, chanted, screamed, cheered, hugged, and stood still to take in this modicum of hope. And though the conviction is far from signaling freedom for Black lives, the celebration represents healing, the will to release some pain, and the power to join together with an eye toward systemic change. Darkness still hangs over America, but some light pierced through on Tuesday. </p> <div class="c-wide-block"> <figure class="e-image"> <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MJjrPVeWllCXCG-nE9g1DtMfaLE=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458257/GettyImages_1232424588.jpg"> <cite>Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images</cite> <figcaption>People celebrate outside the Hennepin County Government Center in Minneapolis after hearing of former police officer Derek’s Chauvin’s guilty verdict.</figcaption> </figure> <figure class="e-image"> <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/--vfT91Sxb76sJo_wDbn8WVoi4g=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458271/GettyImages_1232424640.jpg"> <cite>Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images</cite> <figcaption>The Derek Chauvin verdict has been nearly a year in coming.</figcaption> </figure> <figure class="e-image"> <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3WIlaJBZra8I0VZ_4UcgnzKc8pM=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458314/GettyImages_1232425153.jpg"> <cite>Christian Monterrosa/Bloomberg via Getty Images</cite> <figcaption>Chauvin was found guilty of all three charges — second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter — on April 20. </figcaption> </figure> <figure class="e-image"> <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wpshdagO3Eq46CRHUmV2nHMJBu4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458378/GettyImages_1232425769.jpg"> <cite>Kerem Yucel/AFP via Getty Images</cite> <figcaption>Philonise Floyd (third from left), attorney Ben Crump (center), and Rev.

Now that Derek Chauvin has been convicted, here’s what happens next
</title>
<content type="html">
<figure> <img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1hQDEy5jnA4gkfUBO2K_X0Uvulc=/104x0:1755x1238/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69160537/AP_21110765698327.0.jpg" /> <figcaption>Former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin listens to verdicts at his trial for the murder of George Floyd on April 20, 2021, at the Hennepin County Courthouse in Minneapolis, Minnesota. | Court TV via AP</figcaption> </figure> <p>Sentencing, a civil trial, and appeals.</p> <p id="JCOIdq">After a year of protests, anguish, and a weeks-long trial, former police officer Derek Chauvin has been found <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/4/20/22387556/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-manslaughter">guilty of murdering George Floyd</a>. </p> <p id="d6wclZ">The jury found that, by kneeling on Floyd’s neck until Floyd died, the disgraced ex-cop committed second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter — although, for reasons explained below, he’s likely to only face prison time for the first of these three charges.</p> <p id="VLKKwU">Shortly after Judge Peter Cahill read the verdict and verified that each of the jurors supported Chauvin’s three convictions, the judge announced that he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/20/us/derek-chauvin-sentencing-date.html">sentence Chauvin in eight weeks</a>. Court officials will spend the bulk of that time conducting a <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.115">pre-sentence investigation</a>, a process that examines both Chauvin’s background and the circumstances of his crime, in order to inform Cahill’s sentencing decision.</p> <p id="ijRDQF">Judge Cahill also revoked Chauvin’s bail and ordered him remanded to custody, meaning that he will spend the period between his conviction and his sentencing behind bars.</p> <div class="c-float-right"><div id="EnWc94"><div data-anthem-component="aside:10296380"></div></div></div> <h3 id="h8ZeGA">How much time is Chauvin likely to spend in prison?</h3> <p id="dGSlT8">The length of Chauvin’s sentence is a bit unclear, in part because <a href="https://mn.gov/msgc-stat/documents/Guidelines/2020/August2020MinnSentencingGuidelinesCommentary.pdf">Minnesota’s sentencing guidelines</a> likely give Cahill a fair amount of discretion to increase Chauvin’s sentence up to the statutory maximum.</p> <p id="PqMpCV">Although Chauvin was convicted of violating three separate criminal statutes, he is <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/local/george-floyd/derek-chauvin-trial-george-floyd-death-possible-outcomes/89-feb6e936-317a-4e33-84ac-9640f6072be9">likely to serve his sentences for all three crimes concurrently</a>, meaning that those sentences will all run at the same time. That’s because, while Chauvin was convicted of three separate offenses, he did not commit three separate criminal acts. He committed one — the killing of George Floyd — which violated three different criminal laws.</p> <p id="ccLWQe">The most serious of the three crimes he was convicted of is second-degree unintentional<strong> </strong>murder. Although state law provides that the <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.19">maximum sentence for this crime is 40 years</a>, Minnesota judges typically rely on the state’s sentencing guidelines, rather than statutory maximums, when handing down criminal sentences.</p> <p id="cZsNdY">To determine the proper sentence under these guidelines, a judge ordinarily <a href="https://mn.gov/msgc-stat/documents/Guidelines/2020/2020StandardSentencingGuidelinesGrid.pdf">begins with a grid</a> that lays out the “presumptive sentence” based on the crime that someone was convicted of and their past criminal history.</p> <figure class="e-image"> <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ltP_8rBwEcUZ48kCiDq3zt0711U=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22458405/temp.png"> </figure> <p id="LVH43y">Because Chauvin has no prior criminal conviction, his “criminal history score” under the state sentencing guidelines is zero. Therefore, his base sentence for second-degree unintentional murder is 150 months, or 12.5 years.</p> <p id="DIiEXz">But that’s not the end of the process. The guidelines also allow a sentencing judge to increase an offender’s sentence if a jury determines that <a href="https://sentencing.umn.edu/sites/sentencing.umn.edu/files/departure_form_updated_12-2016.pdf">one or more aggravating factors</a> made the crime especially serious; alternatively, the judge can make this determination if the defendant waives their right to have a jury do so. Chauvin has <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2021/04/20/derek-chauvin-jury-reaches-verdict-trial-george-floyd/">waived this right</a>.</p> <p id="8RSbAB">Prosecutors claim that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/20/us/derek-chauvin-verdict-george-floyd#george-floyd-murder-derek-chauvin-trial">several aggravating factors were present</a> when Chauvin murdered Floyd, including the fact that children were present, that Chauvin acted with “particular cruelty,” and that Chauvin “abused his position of authority.”</p> <p id="W5Z8Tz">If Cahill agrees with the prosecution on any of these points, he has a fair amount of freedom to determine the appropriate sentence, up to the 40-year maximum. According to the guidelines, when a judge departs from the presumptive sentence for a given offender, that departure “is not controlled by the Guidelines, but rather, is an <a href="https://mn.gov/msgc-stat/documents/Guidelines/2020/August2020MinnSentencingGuidelinesCommentary.pdf">exercise of judicial discretion</a> constrained by statute or case law.”</p> <h3 id="lnij59">Can Chauvin appeal his conviction?</h3> <p id="UDatHE">Under Minnesota law, Chauvin has the <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/court_rules/cr/id/28/#:~:text=Appeal%20as%20of%20Right.,under%20Minnesota%20Statutes%2C%20chapter%20590.">right to appeal his conviction</a> or sentence to a state appeals court, and the state court of appeals must hear this appeal and render a judgment on it. As a general rule, a criminal defendant can appeal any legal matter that they objected to at the trial level, so it remains to been seen which specific matters Chauvin’s lawyer decides to raise on appeal.</p> <p id="JEF23H">One issue that is likely to come up on appeal is a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/4/20/22393725/chauvin-verdict-maxine-waters-comments">statement by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA)</a>, where the Congress member suggested that protesters need to “stay on the street” and “get more confrontational.”</p> <p id="N3VJmw">Late in the trial, defense attorney Eric Nelson asked Cahill to declare a mistrial because of Waters’s statement, claiming that it could have prejudiced the jury against his client. Although Cahill labeled Waters’s statement “disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch,” he rejected the request for a mistrial — noting, among other things, that the jury was instructed to avoid news reports.</p> <p id="5AKEUg">Nevertheless, Cahill also commented that Waters’s comment “may have given you something on appeal.” (President Joe Biden also suggested in a public statement earlier in the day that the evidence against Chauvin is “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/biden-says-he-is-praying-for-right-verdict-in-murder-trial-of-derek-chauvin-11618938767">overwhelming</a>,” but he made these comments while the jury was sequestered, so it’s highly unlikely that jurors were aware of them.)</p> <p id="0doBMo">Realistically, an appeals court is unlikely to second-guess Cahill’s decision to allow the trial to move forward. Though the Supreme Court has recognized that, in extreme cases, news reports can so severely prejudice a jury that their decision to convict a defendant is invalid, these sorts of claims are typically disfavored.</p> <p id="3vq22N">As the Court held most recently in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1394.pdf"><em>Skilling v. United States</em></a> (2010), “a trial court’s findings of juror impartiality may be overturned only for manifest error.” As a general rule, appeals courts are advised to defer to trial judges in cases alleging juror prejudice, on the theory that the trial judge is better able to observe the jury and determine if the jurors are somehow tainted.</p> <p id="ltqsuZ">Indeed, if appeals courts were too quick to overturn convictions because a public figure expressed an opinion about the case, then it’s doubtful that any high-profile conviction could stand. As the Supreme Court <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1104642225155375579&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">warned more than 140 years ago</a>: </p> <blockquote><p id="YrwTW4">[E]very case of public interest is almost, as a matter of necessity, brought to the attention of all the intelligent people in the vicinity, and scarcely any one can be found among those best fitted for jurors who has not read or heard of it, and who has not some impression or some opinion in respect to its merits.</p></blockquote> <p id="7OCEEa">This warning is all the more true today, and it’s especially true in the Chauvin trial, a case that inspired months of protests in cities across the nation. It was inevitable that jurors would have read about this case and potentially heard other people’s opinions about it before they were empaneled. Given the extraordinary amount of news coverage surrounding this trial, it’s unlikely that Waters’s comment was the tipping point that pushed a juror into convicting Chauvin — if the jurors were even aware of that comment in the first place.</p> <h3 id="XgCxCr">Will there be a civil trial against Chauvin?</h3> <p id="XX9uUH">Last July, lawyers representing George Floyd’s family <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mnd.188749/gov.uscourts.mnd.188749.1.0.pdf">filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against Chauvin</a>, the city of Minneapolis, and three other former officers who allegedly contributed to Floyd’s murder <strong>— </strong>Tou Thao, Thomas Lane, and J. Alexander Kueng. The suit alleges that these former officers used “excessive and deadly force in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and clearly established law.”</p> <p id="Vg49s7">The city agreed to settle this case for an <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/city-minneapolis-considering-settlement-george-floyd-s-family-n1260868">eye-popping $27 million</a> last month, but the suit against the four former officers remains live. </p> <p id="3O0d9V">Realistically, it’s not clear how much money is actually at stake in the suit against the ex-cops. It’s unlikely that any of these four individuals has deep pockets, especially after they have all hired legal counsel to defend them in criminal trials. But this civil suit could provide additional vindication for Floyd’s family.</p> <p id="SoTWkC">It’s also unclear whether this civil lawsuit will be resolved anytime soon. The defendants asked the judge to stay any proceedings in the case “<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mnd.188749/gov.uscourts.mnd.188749.53.0_1.pdf">pending resolution of a parallel criminal case against the individual Defendants</a>.” The three remaining officers are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/after-chauvin-minnesota-set-prosecute-three-other-officers-floyd-death-2021-04-20/">expected to be tried in August</a> for aiding and abetting Floyd’s murder.</p>

Biden urges Congress to not look away from George Floyd
</title>
<content type="html">
<figure> <img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1fqn2AphPvbxLs_PShEZ913OVQ8=/300x0:2967x2000/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69160520/AP_21110841422976.0.jpg" /> <figcaption>President Biden and Vice President Harris addressed the country after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd. | Evan Vucci/AP</figcaption> </figure> <p>Biden promised George Floyd’s family to fight for policing reforms. He needs Congress to act.</p> <p id="X32Uv3">After the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/4/20/22387556/derek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-manslaughter">conviction</a> of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd, President Joe Biden pleaded with the nation — and Congress — not to look away.</p> <p id="OhKcxq">“This can be a moment of significant change,” Biden said on Tuesday. “We can’t leave this moment thinking our work is done. We have to look at those 9 minutes and 29 seconds; we have to listen.”</p> <p id="a73xwZ">Biden said he spoke to Floyd’s family after the verdict came down on Tuesday night.<strong> </strong>The president said he told them he would “continue to fight” to pass the bill that bears Floyd’s name, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, through Congress. </p> <p id="LsSwJL">“We’re going to do a lot; we’re going to stay at it until we get it done,” Biden told Floyd’s family in a <a href="https://twitter.com/attorneycrump/status/1384623880900419584?s=21">phone call after the verdict</a> that was recorded on video by the Floyd family’s attorney Ben Crump. “That and a lot more. … This gives us a shot to deal with genuine, systemic racism.”</p> <div id="5d5tPv"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">President Biden and VP Harris call the Floyd family after the GUILTY verdict! Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@POTUS</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/VP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@VP</a> for your support! We hope that we can count on you for the police reform we NEED in America! ✊ <a href="https://t.co/cg4V2D5tlI">pic.twitter.com/cg4V2D5tlI</a></p>— Ben Crump (@AttorneyCrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/AttorneyCrump/status/1384623880900419584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 20, 2021</a> </blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </div> <p id="l9LAtu">“Nothing can ever bring their brother, their father back,” Biden said. “But this can be a giant step forward in the march toward justice in America. It is the work we do every day to change hearts and minds as well as laws and policies. Only then will full justice and full equality be delivered to all Americans.”</p> <p id="uVjc7l">It will be an uphill battle to deliver on that promise. Biden may be president, but he is still limited by what he can do alone on the issues of criminal justice and policing. In his Tuesday night speech, the president mentioned two of his nominees for the US Department of Justice who have a long history of focusing on civil rights. But without action from Congress, Biden’s plea will just be another heartfelt speech. </p> <p id="BuMrcE">Close to a year since Floyd’s murder in Minneapolis, the president made a direct appeal to a slow-moving Congress not to delay any longer. </p> <p id="gaE8lt">“We also need Congress to act,” Biden said. “George Floyd was murdered a year ago. There is meaningful police reform legislation under his name. It should not take a whole year to get it done.”</p> <h3 id="UmFLyz">Where the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act stands in Congress</h3> <p id="BRyXdU">First introduced last year by senators including current Vice President Kamala Harris, the Justice in Policing Act <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/3/3/22295856/george-floyd-justice-in-policing-act-2021-passed-house">once again passed the Democratic-controlled House</a> in March. It awaits movement in the US Senate, where Democrats have the majority by just one vote.</p> <p id="8Uzb0e">The policing reform bill only has a shot of passage if<strong> </strong>the 60-vote Senate filibuster requirement is eliminated, and if Senate<strong> </strong>Democrats stay united to all vote for it.<strong> </strong>Among other provisions, the bill would ban chokeholds and end qualified immunity for officers, a legal doctrine that sets an especially high bar to sue police officers for misconduct. </p> <p id="kjGudp">Senate Republicans don’t support the bill and have offered their own version — the JUSTICE Act — which mainly would improve data collection on police use of force and “no knock” warrants, and calls on state and local police to more thorough document misconduct. </p> <p id="LQMffu">“There’s no question in my mind that the jury reached the right verdict” in the Chauvin trial, Republican Sen. Tim Scott (SC), the Senate GOP’s only Black Republican and a main sponsor of the JUSTICE Act, said in a statement Tuesday. Even so, Democrats and Republicans in Congress remain far apart on a solution to police killings of unarmed Black people. </p> <p id="9SRDHo">“This is not just about one officer, or one police department,” Rep. Steven Horsford (D-NV), the first vice chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, told the New York Times’s Luke Broadwater on Tuesday, reacting to the Chauvin verdict. “This is about a system that we still need to reform. We need the Senate to act, because until the legislation is brought up and passed and signed by the President, every single day Black families are waking up to more incidents.”</p> <p id="79KDms">Horsford said that a bipartisan group, including Scott and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), are meeting to find consensus on what Republicans and Democrats can agree on. But many Senate Republicans object to Democrats’ provision to end qualified immunity for police officers, and think the scope of the Justice in Policing Act is too large. </p> <p id="HAjza8">The bill is set to be heard next month in the Senate Judiciary Committee, meaning a final vote may not come until late spring or summer. Black members of Congress told reporters that they, like Biden, hoped the Chauvin verdict was the start of a sea change in the country, prompting real progress for Black people who are all too familiar with systemic and institutional racism in America. </p> <p id="hKxOGV">“Hopefully this is the beginning of a turning point in our country,” said Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA). “Where people who have seen this trauma over and over again will know that we have equal protection under the law.”</p>

<title>Soccer fans destroyed the Super League</title>
<content type="html">
<figure> <img alt="A soccer fan holds a sign that reads “Football belongs to us, not you.”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8AJLoOUu_4O1S_hGNNt0GQeQGWg=/441x0:4472x3023/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69160039/1313517157.0.jpg" /> <figcaption>Fans hold banners opposing Chelsea’s founding of the proposed European Super League on April 20 in London, England. | Chloe Knott/Danehouse/Getty Images</figcaption> </figure> <p>Why soccer fans thought the European Super League super sucked.</p> <p id="uVjbqk">Twelve of the richest European soccer teams came up with an ingenious scheme to make even more money: Instead of taking part in a longstanding tournament with poorer and mostly weaker teams, they would create their own exclusive “Super League” to attract global interest, prestige, and cash.</p> <p id="MYE6bH">There was just one problem: Fans hated the idea, and their revolt caused what would’ve been the biggest threat to the game in decades to dissipate after just 48 hours.</p> <p id="FHecf7">On Sunday, 12 of the richest teams from England, Spain, and Italy — the <em>richest</em>, mind you, not necessarily the <em>best</em> — announced they would create the <a href="https://www.arsenal.com/news/european-super-league-announced">European Super League</a>. It would likely replace a more inclusive, preexisting annual tournament, the <a href="https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/">Champions League</a>, where the top teams from European countries’ leagues compete to determine the continent’s strongest squad. </p> <p id="c2RbQS">Then came the backlash, leading all six British teams and reportedly two Spanish teams to back out of the proposal after just two days of relentless fan pressure. The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fsoccer%2Fmanchester-united%2Fstory%2F4365318%2Fwoodward-out-as-manchester-united-executive-vice-chairman&amp;referrer=vox.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22393815%2Fsuper-league-europe-football-soccer-fans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">chair of one of them is on the verge of stepping down</a>. And all clubs <a href="https://twitter.com/City_Xtra/status/1384572689923420164?s=20">plan to discuss</a> abandoning the idea, at least for the time being.</p> <div id="a0fAeT"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">As a result of listening to you and the wider football community over recent days we are withdrawing from the proposed Super League. <br><br>We made a mistake, and we apologise for it.</p>— Arsenal (@Arsenal) <a href="https://twitter.com/Arsenal/status/1384626900056805379?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 20, 2021</a> </blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </div> <p id="XCwLuu">How did such an idea spark so much passion and backlash? After all, who wouldn’t want to see the most prominent clubs play each other regularly? And how did the Super League fall apart so quickly?</p> <p id="iBRIPR">Consider this admittedly imperfect analogy: Imagine if the 12 richest NBA teams decided to form their own playoffs, regardless of how they performed during the regular season and without the league’s approval. That wouldn’t be fair to poorer teams who might’ve earned a playoff spot, and also goes against how NBA fans expect things to run.</p> <p id="H6Jo4j">That’s kind of what happened here. The 12 original teams — AC Milan, Arsenal, Atlético Madrid, Chelsea, FC Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Tottenham Hotspur — wanted to create a top-tier competition they’d all automatically qualify for regardless of their actual on-field performance, and would reap the financial rewards of without having to share any of that revenue with those pesky smaller teams. </p> <p id="0wQAaG">The road to the Super League proposal was paved with greed, but also genuine panic caused by declining revenues during the coronavirus pandemic. And other than executives poised to make big bucks, few were happy about the plan. The backlash from fans, current and former players, and football/soccer media was thus fierce.</p> <p id="Yaz3q3">The idea is “nothing less than the death of football as we know it,” Germany’s leading sports monthly, <a href="https://11freunde.de/artikel/macht-kaputt-was-euch-kaputt-macht/3681000?utm_source=in_article&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=related">11 Freunde</a>, wrote this week. “[It’s] an attempt to turn a sport which millions love, into a weekly circus show in order to squeeze the last shitty cent into the pockets of the superrich.”</p> <p id="vn5gq4">That anger — which also came from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/apr/19/ministers-urged-to-take-action-over-european-super-league-plan">UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/frances-macron-opposes-breakaway-european-super-league-2021-04-18/">French President Emmanuel Macron</a> — led <a href="https://au.sports.yahoo.com/chelsea-super-league-withdrawal-175927588.html">Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool, and Tottenham</a> in England, and possibly <a href="https://clutchpoints.com/atletico-madrid-barcelona-also-opt-out-of-super-league/">FC Barcelona and Atlético Madrid</a> in Spain, to back out of the Super League. What’s more, the <a href="https://twitter.com/brfootball/status/1384582566926340097?s=20">chair of Manchester United</a>, one of the teams most strongly pushing for the elite tournament, reportedly will resign on Tuesday under pressure.</p> <figure class="e-image"> <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o4p8tcjyI4DxapgPaeOd8lrO2SY=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457946/1232402804.jpg"> <cite>Various/AFP/Getty Images</cite> <figcaption>Emblems of the 12 “founding members” of the short-lived European Super League.</figcaption> </figure> <p id="OZbfoU">While fans were angry at the idea in general, what they were really upset about was that the scheme proved that the decades-long ethos of soccer — a game for anyone and everyone, where prestige is won and lost on the pitch, not bought — isn’t really valued by the executives running things.</p> <p id="s7PYBN">“I earnestly felt sick when I heard the news” of the Super League proposal, said Nate Scott, editor of USA Today’s For the Win sports website and fan of Fulham, a middling London team. “European soccer relies on the tenet that ‘anything is possible,’ on any given night you have your chance to upset the giants. It seems like those days are ending.”</p> <p id="1618955950.038000">For the moment, they’re not. Rarely, if ever, do you see a plan hatched by billionaires fail so fast against the will of the people.</p> <h3 id="1618955952.038200">The European Super League was all about money</h3> <p id="1643E8">Financial Times columnist Simon Kuper noted that the idea for a Super League has floated around for decades. On Monday, he cited <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7472aa5e-51fb-467e-a3f8-13cda10cc4f1">this passage</a> written by journalist Arthur Hopcraft in 1968: “There was a general expectation a little while ago of what was called a Super League, in which all the leading European clubs would play, breaking away from the domestic leagues in their own countries. It has not materialised.”</p> <p id="MlC3K0">On Sunday, it materialized.</p> <p id="5fyT0w">So why did it happen now? Experts say the answer is money. </p> <p id="qzzziB">Simply put, the Covid-19 pandemic — and the need to keep people from gathering in large groups, like at, say, soccer stadiums, to prevent the virus’s spread — hit the world’s soccer teams hard, but particularly the biggest clubs. </p> <p id="VavuZR">They’re the ones with the highest payrolls since they have the best, most expensive players; and they’re the ones with the largest, costliest stadiums to maintain. Without fans in attendance because of the pandemic, these teams’ balance sheets sank more and more into the red.</p> <p id="JHRvz5">The Champions League — the yearly best-of-Europe tournament run by UEFA, the continent’s governing soccer body — attracts tons of cash for teams in normal times. But these aren’t normal times, and so the body’s ability to help teams cover expenses has dwindled.</p> <p id="prorIz">UEFA told clubs last October that “nearly $600 million has been lost due to the pandemic, and payouts to clubs will be reduced over the next five seasons,” according to <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/uefa-champions-league/story/4213902/how-a-european-super-league-could-happen-and-spell-doom-for-the-champions-league">ESPN’s Gabrielle Marcotti</a> at the time. </p> <p id="Bc0exj">This is hurting Europe’s richest clubs. Consider the plight of my beloved <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/12/sports/soccer/barcelona-messi-contract.html">FC Barcelona</a>, one of the 12 “founding members” of the Super League. Most of its troubles are due to its own gross mismanagement, but the coronavirus didn’t help, which is why it considered creating the tournament in the first place.</p> <p id="x8Sfjb">A former Barcelona board member told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/12/sports/soccer/barcelona-messi-contract.html">New York Times</a> in March that the pandemic will cost the club around $500 million in revenue. That’s a problem when the team’s annual salary bill hovers around $770 million, equal to about 74 percent of the team’s pre-coronavirus income. </p> <figure class="e-image"> <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UkJZr8PmJV1TSX345odJyk04x6w=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457963/1313092281.jpg"> <cite>Fran Santiago/Getty Images</cite> <figcaption>Lionel Messi of FC Barcelona holds the trophy after winning the Copa del Rey final match with Athletic Club on April 17 in Seville, Spain.</figcaption> </figure> <p id="Nnjeqt">And it gets worse: “In its most recent financial reports, Barcelona announced a loss for the year of $117 million. It estimates that it already has lost $246 million as a result of the pandemic,” the Times reported.</p> <p id="BQRs72">The other teams that wanted the Super League are in similar situations. So instead of relying on the hard-hit Champions League for cash, they decided to create their own league to try to recoup costs as quickly as possible. </p> <p id="72EH7e">The thinking was that a tournament composed of Europe’s top teams will attract more TV contracts and sponsorships, and those teams wouldn’t have to share revenues with UEFA or other smaller clubs who make it into any given year’s Champions League tournament. Within a few years, the goal was to have the Super League replace the Champions League altogether.</p> <p id="2hDPFq">That smacked of a plot to make money at the expense of others, a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.barnesandnoble.com%2Fw%2Fthe-club-joshua-robinson%2F1128704744&amp;referrer=vox.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22393815%2Fsuper-league-europe-football-soccer-fans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">common move</a> by the game’s elite. JPMorgan Chase even committed around <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/apr/19/jp-morgan-european-super-league">$4 billion</a> to get the Super League up and running. </p> <p id="1y0E00">The league’s proponents didn’t exactly hide that that was their true motivation, either. “Here at Real Madrid we’ve lost a lot of money, we are all going through a very bad situation,” the team’s president and Super League chair <a href="https://www.si.com/soccer/2021/04/20/super-league-florentino-perez-ceferin-uefa-real-madrid#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHere%20at%20Real%20Madrid%20we,will%20save%20the%20clubs%20financially.%E2%80%9D">Florentino Pérez</a> said this week. “When there is no profit, the only way is to play more competitive games during the week. The Super League will save clubs financially.”</p> <p id="kcveAd">The Super League clubs also argued that it would be more fun for fans to watch two famous teams play each other during every round instead of, say, a team from Stockholm, Sweden, against a team from Budapest, Hungary, in the Champions League. </p> <p id="wXiwej">It seems they didn’t actually bother to run that idea past the fans first, though. If they had, they might have avoided the massive public outcry their proposal sparked.</p> <p id="SHAFp5">After news of the Super League proposal broke, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/uefa-could-ban-super-league-players-euro-2020-world-cup-749ce4257b0f9a17b3fc34d60cccd00c">UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin</a> threatened that any player who participates in the new competition wouldn’t be allowed to represent their national team in tournaments like the World Cup. “UEFA and the footballing world stand united against the disgraceful self-serving proposal we have seen in the last 24 hours from a select few clubs in Europe that are fueled purely by greed above all else,” he said.</p> <p id="hrcBPj">It’s unclear if he actually wields such power, experts say. But the threat alone seemed to have been effective. <a href="https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2021/04/19/super-league-plans-players-react-ander-herrera-mesut-ozil">Ander Herrera</a>, a Spanish national team member who previously played for Manchester United, denounced the move as “the rich stealing what the people created.” And <a href="https://twitter.com/MesutOzil1088/status/1384100211815976960?s=20">Mesut Ozil</a>, who used to play for Arsenal and Germany’s squad, tweeted “Kids grow up dreaming to win the World Cup and the Champions League — not any Super League.”</p> <div id="VfKViT"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kids grow up dreaming to win the World Cup and the Champions League - not any Super League. The enjoyment of big games is that they only happen once or twice a year, not every week.

It’s supposed to be about the game.</h3> <p id="trpARX">While professional soccer started off in the <a href="https://snapsoccer.com/youth-soccer/a-brief-history-of-soccer/">1800s</a> as a game for the elite, it fairly quickly became a popular game. By popular, I don’t mean famous or trendy, I mean “popular” in the sense that the game was meant for anyone to play and watch. </p> <p id="FbPOSk">“The history of these clubs is that they were local, and plumbers would play and fans would support their town,” said USA Today’s Scott. “It was almost a point of civic pride.“</p> <p id="PUluqE">That’s no longer the case. Soccer in recent years has become big business, which is to be expected as it’s the world’s most popular game. Its players, such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/6/12/17424948/2018-world-cup-messi-ronaldo-neymar-salah-players">Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and Juventus’ Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, are some of the most recognizable and bankable figures in sports. The game’s rise has led to massive endorsement deals, TV contracts, major sponsorships, and multimillion-dollar profits for well-managed clubs.</p> <figure class="e-image"> <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G_f1PFCDGJcRA8DTCPMZ6ayeXMo=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457965/1313455871.jpg"> <cite>Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</cite> <figcaption>Banners and football scarves are tied to the fences around Anfield Stadium, the home of Liverpool Football Club, in protest over the European Super League on April 20.</figcaption> </figure> <p id="FmUKnh">Europe’s strongest leagues thus attracted billionaire investors, many of whom became owners and turned local clubs into ultra-rich international franchises and brands. </p> <p id="uXIjzE">Many of these investors didn’t come from the club’s local fanbase, or even the countries where the clubs were located, but rather from places like the <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/483802-liverpool-sold-after-years-of-uncertainty-to-boston-red-sox-owner-john-henry">US</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leeigel/2021/03/19/chelsea-owner-and-billionaire-roman-abramovich-on-the-past-present-and-future-of-the-club/">Russia</a>, and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/08/08/the-global-politics-of-the-biggest-story-in-soccer/?itid=lk_inline_manual_13">Middle East</a>. Generally speaking, their main goal was less to give local fans something to be proud of, and more to fund win-at-all-cost machines with global reach and revenue streams.</p> <p id="jFztRv">That’s long been a source of conflict. <a href="https://twitter.com/Football__Tweet/status/1383833537095245825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1383833537095245825%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.si.com%2Fextra-mustard%2F2021%2F04%2F19%2Fsuper-league-plans-players-react-ander-herrera-mesut-ozil">Gary Neville</a>, once Manchester United’s captain and now a commentator for Sky Sports in the UK, railed against this trend during a television hit. “It’s pure greed. They’re impostors,” he said about foreign owners caring only for big bucks. “They’re nothing to do with football in this country ... The fans need protecting.”</p> <div id="ZYvOGz"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gary Neville is the people's hero right now. Unreal piece of television about the European Super League. <a href="https://t.co/ypdQbdQfs7">pic.twitter.com/ypdQbdQfs7</a></p>— Football Tweet (@Football__Tweet) <a href="https://twitter.com/Football__Tweet/status/1383833537095245825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2021</a> </blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </div> <p id="WxhvKu">This has also long angered local fans, due to an increased gap between the game’s richer and poorer clubs. When the Champions League came around, it was typically the wealthiest clubs competing for the title, because they could buy the best players and managers, while teams with smaller coffers typically failed to go deep in the tournament.</p> <p id="Mys5B4">And <em>that</em>, experts note, is why the Super League bothers fans so much. “I know these clubs are always going to be in the Champions League competing for the title anyway,” Scott said. “The deck is already stacked so much in these mega clubs’ favor, so [the Super League] just feels gratuitous, it feels piggish.”</p> <p id="ayTJ4x">Think about a team like Atalanta from Bergamo, Italy — one of the regions hardest hit early in the pandemic. The club is by no means destitute, but it’s not among the wealthiest, especially compared to those trying to form the Super League. And yet the team made it all the way to the Champion League’s quarterfinals during the 2019-20 season, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3VYsISvUy4&amp;feature=onebox">nearly defeating a superstar-filled side from Paris</a>.</p> <p id="A3C1p7">Atalanta’s success became a global story, with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/sports/soccer/atalanta-bergamo-champions-league.html">New York Times</a> even covering how the team’s performance gave Bergamo’s faithful something to cheer about. “The suffering of the people mourning for their families cannot be relieved,” Maria Beatrice Stasi, the director general of the Pope John XXIII hospital, told the Times. “Sport cannot overcome that grief. But for the city as a whole, a city that has suffered a lot, it offers hope.”</p> <p id="Dflq4g">The creation of a Super League would make a story like Atalanta’s less likely. While the tournament would allow for some non-founding European teams to play in the league, the number of spots for them would sharply decline. In essence, the chance for a dream run — like when a low seed makes it to the Final Four in college basketball — would basically go away.</p> <p id="cvDG6M">That strips out what many fans love about the game: that any team on any given day has the chance to beat the big clubs. “That’s what’s leading to my heartbreak,” said Scott. “I should be an adult about this, but I still believe in the fairytale.” His <a href="https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/match/2000953--fulham-vs-juventus/">Fulham, after all, once beat mighty Juventus</a> in an international competition, a game that continues to live on in team lore.</p> <p id="s7AvlR">Scott clearly wasn’t the only one heartbroken. Even fans of the teams creating the Super League railed against the decision. Outside Anfield, Liverpool’s stadium, fans put up a banner reading “<a href="https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1384249208329310210?s=20">LFC Fans Against Super League</a>.” Current and retired players, including former Manchester United and England national team captain <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC08HPDlJlA">Rio Ferdinand</a>, also decried the move. “It’s a disgrace, it’s a war on football,” he said on British television this week. </p> <p id="Vm0B8U">And <a href="https://twitter.com/TrentAA/status/1384598444870938625?s=20">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a>, a star player for Liverpool right now, posted his displeasure with the Super League on Twitter, saying he and others were speaking out “For the fans. For the city.”</p> <div id="RTG5mU"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">For the fans. For the city. <a href="https://t.co/JrLav3fhTo">https://t.co/JrLav3fhTo</a></p>— Trent Alexander-Arnold (@TrentAA) <a href="https://twitter.com/TrentAA/status/1384598444870938625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 20, 2021</a> </blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </div> <p id="fxVGhZ">That backlash caused the six British teams to decide that the trouble of a Super League wasn’t worth the rancor. Chelsea’s fans, after all, blocked the team’s bus as it approached its home stadium ahead of a Tuesday game. It took a club legend, former goalkeeper <a href="https://twitter.com/AbsoluteChelsea/status/1384559088378556416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1384559088378556416%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fau.sports.yahoo.com%2Fchelsea-super-league-withdrawal-175927588.html">Petr Cech</a>, to get the crowd to let the bus through.</p> <p id="393Fm1">It seems like the Super League may be dead for now, but there’s always the chance that it could come back. If it does, the defining feature of the sport will die as a new elite league forms — but not if the fans have any say in the matter.</p> <p id="xAZRAL"></p>

<title>Derek Chauvin trial and verdict: News and updates</title>

<title>Why Chauvin’s conviction matters</title>
<content type="html">
<figure> <img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JIo_YTlLSf6RYc4C4oWkFtiI8A8=/333x0:3000x2000/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69159379/GettyImages_1232407992.0.jpg" /> <figcaption>Derek Chauvin has been found guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter and could face up to 40 years in prison. | Jason Armond/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images</figcaption> </figure> <p>In America, police are rarely held accountable.</p> <p id="GFMr9j">The Derek Chauvin verdict has been nearly a year in the making. Footage of the murder of George Floyd last May has been viewed by millions worldwide, sparking ongoing international protests against police brutality and igniting policy changes to reform and reimagine the role of police. Though the amount of video footage of the killing was unprecedented and the momentum for justice was undeniable, history did not necessarily point to an easy conviction. </p> <p id="OLcfdX">The former Minneapolis police officer was found guilty of all three charges — second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. That’s rare in a system where it’s uncommon to prosecute police for killing someone, let alone convict them. For example, only <a href="https://www.vox.com/21497089/derek-chauvin-george-floyd-trial-police-prosecutions-black-lives-matter">seven police officers have been convicted of murder</a> for police shootings since 2005. The law favors police — giving them latitude to use force — plus, Americans, including jurors, <a href="https://www.vox.com/22372342/police-reform-derek-chauvin">tend to trust police officers</a>. </p> <p id="QU1WIn">As Chris Slobogin, the director of the criminal justice program at Vanderbilt University, told Vox, “The jury is composed of citizens of the community who want the police to protect them.” </p> <div id="VujVI4"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Chauvin in handcuffs <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DerekChauvinTrial?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DerekChauvinTrial</a> <a href="https://t.co/CvbCkoec6P">pic.twitter.com/CvbCkoec6P</a></p>— Fabiola Cineas (@FabiolaCineas) <a href="https://twitter.com/FabiolaCineas/status/1384615901283160068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 20, 2021</a> </blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </div> <p id="9fLrHR">For this reason, Chauvin’s conviction is significant. The jury’s decision proves that they believed Chauvin acted far outside his duties as a police officer sworn to protect and serve the community. </p> <p id="VxErHN">But as the prosecution noted in its closing statement, the trial was between the state and the defendant — not between the state and policing. Whether the verdict will lead to greater police accountability and build on the momentum ignited by Floyd’s death remains to be seen.</p> <div class="c-float-right"><div id="5mVNRy"><div data-anthem-component="aside:10296380"></div></div></div> <h3 id="lHsya6">The Derek Chauvin trial and verdict, briefly explained</h3> <p id="ugdY3y">At the core of the trial was the video of Floyd’s death: Floyd pleading with officers, saying 27 times he couldn’t breathe, a crowd of bystanders growing over the nine minutes and 29 seconds in which Chauvin held Floyd down. Jurors must have watched the fatal encounter and various angles of it — a combination of bystander cellphone video, store and street surveillance footage, and police body camera video — more than three dozen times. </p> <p id="aeAR7o">Aside from the power of the footage itself, the prosecution provided a strong case, <a href="https://www.vox.com/22361875/derek-chauvin-trial-witness-testimony-prosecution">legal experts noted</a>. Beginning on March 29, the prosecution called a total of 38 witnesses, kicking off the trial with the emotional testimony from about a dozen bystanders who witnessed the murder firsthand. </p> <figure class="e-image"> <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2y0-6CASNz0FjxlxzocpUM_3QZc=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22450059/AP_21090714177597.jpeg"> <cite>Minneapolis Police Department/AP</cite> <figcaption>An image from a police body camera shows bystanders filming as police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee on George Floyd’s neck.</figcaption> </figure> <p id="txVYH6">Darnella Frazier, the teenager who filmed the viral video of Floyd’s death, testified to how she saw her Black father, brothers, and uncles in Floyd. Frazier’s 9-year-old cousin, who was also present at the scene, testified to feeling “sad” and “mad” that Chauvin was hurting Floyd. Other witnesses also broke down in tears as they recounted what they saw that day, including 61-year-old bystander Charles McMillian and Genevieve Hansen, an off-duty firefighter who attempted to render aid to Floyd. </p> <p id="Qnjb3n">The prosecution also presented nearly a dozen police officers who testified that Chauvin’s force was excessive and unnecessary, including Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who called what Chauvin did “murder.” Arradondo, along with other officers, claimed that department policy includes deescalation and conflict resolution tactics that Chauvin did not employ. As <a href="https://www.vox.com/22373113/derek-chauvin-trial-police-officers-testify">legal experts noted</a>, that so many officers testified against Chauvin was rare. </p> <figure class="e-image"> <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oejZF0l-CI71mcwooF9YabSDdyY=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22450060/AP_21095608116036.jpg"> <cite>Court TV/AP</cite> <figcaption>Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo testifies. </figcaption> </figure> <p id="1U0qJw">Meanwhile, the medical experts who testified for the prosecution argued that it was Chauvin’s actions that caused Floyd’s heart to stop. Pulmonary and critical care physician Martin Tobin said that Floyd died from a low level of oxygen, which caused arrhythmia, or an irregular heartbeat. Andrew Baker, the medical examiner who deemed Floyd’s death a homicide, cited Chauvin’s restraint and neck compression as the actions that caused Floyd’s heart, enlarged by a severe underlying disease, to beat faster and eventually stop. </p> <p id="tAXa1u">Ultimately, prosecutors<strong> </strong>were able to successfully<strong> </strong>portray Chauvin as an officer who went against police protocol and used force that was disproportionate to any threat that Floyd posed — and that Chauvin’s knee was a significant factor in stopping Floyd’s heart. </p> <p id="wsfcsz">The defense, on the other hand, tried to argue that it was Floyd’s drug use, underlying health conditions, and carbon monoxide from the squad car’s exhaust pipe that contributed to Floyd’s death, not Chauvin’s use of force. Defense attorney Eric J. Nelson also argued that the crowd of bystanders prevented Chauvin from caring for Floyd because they caused a distraction. But in the end, the defense’s two days of testimony from just seven witnesses was not enough to convince jurors that Chauvin was not a factor in Floyd’s death.</p> <p id="mGrHXe">Second-degree unintentional murder was the most serious charge of the three that prosecutors presented to jurors, meaning he caused Floyd’s death while committing assault; with that alone, Chauvin could face up to 40 years in prison. He was also convicted of the lesser offenses of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.</p> <div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"><aside id="nofhia"><q>Over the past five years, police have killed an average of three people per day, according to Mapping Police Violence</q></aside></div> <p id="f3Zot0">During the trial, jurors were instructed to stay away from the news and any outside information about the trial. In the background, however, community tensions over police accountability only grew. At the start of week three of the trial, a police officer shot and killed 20-year-old Daunte Wright just 10 miles from where the trial was taking place. Businesses and government buildings in downtown Minneapolis have been boarded up due to the protests in response to Wright’s killing and the impending verdict in the high-profile trial.</p> <p id="yeKWHj">While we don’t know much about the jurors, we do know they were uncharacteristically diverse — one Black woman, three Black men, two multiracial women, four white women, and two white men. The jury questionnaire revealed that the jurors had mixed views on the police, Black Lives Matter, and “blue lives matter,” with some of the jurors saying they wanted to hear more about Minneapolis police training and whether Chauvin’s restraint was within protocol. </p> <p id="WJlLpw">For Floyd’s family, a conviction represents an end,<strong> </strong>if not necessarily the end. Ahead of the trial’s conclusion, Floyd’s brother <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/rev-al-sharpton-to-lead-noon-prayer-with-floyd-family-outside-hennepin-county-courthouse">Philonise Floyd told reporters</a>: “After we get the verdict and we get this conviction, we’ll be able to breathe.” </p> <figure class="e-image"> <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ciqhh0hJ8eTrbGZaPECdDy7rOKc=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22456928/GettyImages_1232407911.jpg"> <cite>Jason Armond/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images</cite> <figcaption>From left, attorney Ben Crump, Philonise Floyd, and Rev. Al Sharpton pray alongside other family members of George Floyd and Daunte Wright on April 19 in Minneapolis.</figcaption> </figure> <p id="OQWXop">Overall,<em> </em>justice will take more than one conviction. Justice means addressing — and finding real solutions to — the larger systemic issues in policing, and maybe even abolishing the institution itself.</p> <p id="uoyKoC">“What we cannot do is rest all of our hopes on the trial when, in essence, what we’re talking about is a system that makes this behavior permissible in the first place,” Seft Hunter, director of Black-led organizing for the social justice organization Community Change, told Vox ahead of the verdict. “The very structure that brought us to this moment remains intact and will again bring us to similar moments in the future.”</p> <h3 id="EGFa7y">The problems with policing are vast and still need immediate attention </h3> <p id="d2DHon">The problems with policing don’t begin and end with Derek Chauvin. </p> <p id="CJgp9P">As the past few weeks alone have shown, these problems exist in Chicago, where, hours before the Chauvin trial began, a police officer shot <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/adam-toledo-chicago-police-shooting-video-2021-04-15/">13-year-old Adam Toledo</a> in the chest as the boy raised his hands. And in Maryland, where, as the trial approached its conclusion, police shot and killed <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/14/us/peyton-ham-maryland-trooper-shooting/index.html">16-year-old Peyton Ham</a>, who was holding a toy gun. And they certainly exist around the area where Floyd was killed, with the recent killing of 20-year-old <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/4/12/22379984/daunte-wright-minnesota-police-killing-traffic-stop-brooklyn-center">Wright</a> just outside Minneapolis.</p> <p id="pksCZF">Over the past five years, police have killed an average of three people per day, according to <a href="https://mappingpoliceviolence.org">Mapping Police Violence</a>. The specter of death at the hands of the police is a particularly vivid one for Black men; one <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793">2019 study</a><strong> </strong>found that Black men have about a 1 in 1,000 chance of being killed by police. So rapid are these shootings that the deaths, anger, and calls for justice begin to feel cyclic. Legal proceedings against one former officer often cannot conclude before the next case begins. </p> <p id="Chehow">Chauvin’s conviction represents an interruption of that cycle — it is an anomaly. But it doesn’t mean the cycle is over. Or that all want it to end: An April <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2021/4/dfp-vox-police-reform.pdf">Vox/Data for Progress</a> poll found 77 percent of likely voters would like to see more officers on patrol in their neighborhoods, while an April <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=3696">Quinnipiac University</a> poll found that 55 percent of Americans approve of how police officers currently do their jobs.</p> <p id="M8qv4r">Despite this, Floyd’s killing had a momentous impact. It led millions to join the calls of activists and disproportionately affected communities in advocating for major changes to policing and the criminal justice system. There was a broad awakening that policing was problematic, with months of protests that led to an expansive view of what solutions might be possible, including the beginnings of real policy change.</p> <p id="K46F3f">Some advocates have proposed reforming police departments more broadly, with <a href="https://www.vox.com/22295749/policing-reform-federal-oversight-voting-rights-act-mazzone-rushin">stronger federal oversight</a> that would provide Justice Department supervision of state and local policing; others have pushed to <a href="https://8cantwait.org/">ban certain techniques and practices</a>, like warrants that allow police to enter homes without knocking or policies that allow officers to shoot at moving vehicles. And there have been numerous <a href="https://www.vox.com/21562565/ballot-measures-policing-first-step">local reform wins</a> across the country over the past year, including expanded oversight boards in Oakland and <a href="https://www.kqed.org/voterguide/election-2020-san-francisco-county-proposition-d">San Francisco</a> as well as new use of force policies in states like <a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/governor-baker-signs-police-reform-legislation">Massachusetts</a> and <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2020/06/19/polis-signs-broad-police-accountability-and-reform-bill-into-law/">Colorado</a>. </p> <p id="ygXLfB">Others, though, want to go further.<strong> </strong></p> <div> <figure class="e-image"> <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xym8Wfdo0ZEkzP8LojiNMFs5dMQ=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22450095/GettyImages_1232213810.jpg"> <cite>Stephen Maturen/Getty Images</cite> <figcaption>In the wake of Floyd’s death, there have been growing demands to reform, defund, and abolish the police.</figcaption> </figure> </div> <p id="KbzxZp">Following Floyd’s death, the movement to defund the police rose to prominence — essentially, taking financial resources from departments and reinvesting them in other areas, including education, housing, and social services. The idea was, and still is, the subject of great debate.</p> <p id="KS2pCz">Numerous polls have found little support for the idea when respondents were asked specifically about the term “defunding the police”; a March <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1516588&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ipsos.com%2Fen-us%2Famericans-trust-law-enforcement-desire-protect-law-and-order-rise&amp;referrer=vox.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vox.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22387556%2Fderek-chauvin-verdict-guilty-murder-manslaughter" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">USA Today/Ipsos</a> poll, for instance, found 18 percent of Americans back it. But just as many polls have found support for the idea behind it: In the same poll, respondents were also asked if they support reallocating police funds — which is the same thing as defunding — and more said they did. More recently, <a href="https://www.filesforprogress.org/datasets/2021/4/dfp-vox-police-reform.pdf">Vox/Data for Progress</a> asked the same question and found most likely voters in support of defunding: 63 percent. </p> <p id="wnOJhH">This growing awareness and support, and the work of organizers, has already led some cities to begin early experiments with defunding, and some activists hope that the high-profile nature of this trial could lead to more.</p> <p id="DBLb0O"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/11/4/21549019/measure-j-police-abolition-defund-reform-black-lives-matter-protest-2020-election-george-floyd"><strong>Los Angeles voters</strong></a> approved a defunding measure in the 2020 election, and the <a href="https://abc7.com/defund-the-police-lapd-black-lives-matter-los-angeles-city-council/10384293/"><strong>city council</strong></a><strong> </strong>there recently approved the transfer of $32 million to programs that provide alternatives to policing as well as public health initiatives.

There could still be mental health professionals for crises and negotiators for noise complaints and detectives to solve murders. There just wouldn’t be armed individuals roaming the streets allowed to kill, assault, and harm people with near impunity. </p> <p id="SzQhss">“We have dismantled systems that were older and more ingrained in society [than] policing,” activist and artist <a href="https://twitter.com/BreeNewsome/status/1382907539210301448?s=20">Bree Newsome wrote</a> recently. “If we can end things like monarchal rule and the slave trade, we can end policing.”</p> <h3 id="WNAFgJ">George Floyd’s death shed new light on the need to change policing </h3> <p id="gR2FBu">Conversations about increasing the resources put into public health, about defunding and abolishing the police, were happening prior to George Floyd’s death. But they weren’t happening with the level of intensity, or with the seriousness, that they are happening now. Cities weren’t dismantling their police departments, and massive spending bills didn’t have funding for municipalities to try out taking mental health crisis duties away from officers. </p> <p id="42p5pr">The viral video of Floyd’s murder has fundamentally altered the way Americans think about the police. It also appears to have weighed heavily on the jurors’ minds, yielding an uncommon outcome. </p> <p id="arwier">With Chauvin now convicted, the efforts of activists will continue, as will experiments around defunding and alternatives to policing.

What Maxine Waters actually said about the Chauvin trial
</title>
<content type="html">
<figure> <img alt="Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) speaks to the media on April 17 during an ongoing protest in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hRRny1uKubgD7e4R4-3qgDQWi5Q=/187x0:3654x2600/1310x983/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69158425/GettyImages_1232376763.0.jpg" /> <figcaption>Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) speaks to the media on April 17 during an ongoing protest in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota. | Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty</figcaption> </figure> <p>She didn’t tell anyone to riot.</p> <p id="QSEdPh">Closing arguments in Derek Chauvin’s trial for the murder of George Floyd wrapped up Monday, and after the jury was excused to begin deliberations, Judge Peter Cahill had some tough words — for Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA).</p> <p id="lwnPLR">While attending a protest in Minneapolis on Saturday, the longtime Congress member and chair of the House Committee on Financial Services said she thought Chauvin needed to be convicted of murder and urged protesters to “get more confrontational.”</p> <p id="jMgbA4">These comments received enormous attention in conservative media — with critics distorting Waters’s comments to claim she had encouraged protesters to riot if they didn’t like the verdict. (Waters’s actual comments fell far short of that, and she insisted <a href="https://thegrio.com/2021/04/19/maxine-waters-republicans-confrontational-comment/">in a subsequent interview</a> that she was “nonviolent.”)</p> <p id="BZ2TWx">“I just don’t know how this jury can really be said to be that they are free from the taint of this, and now that we have US representatives threatening acts of violence in relation to this specific case, it’s — it’s mind-boggling to me, Judge,” defense attorney Eric Nelson said in requesting a mistrial.</p> <p id="8FGVtF">“I’m aware that Congresswoman Waters was talking specifically about this trial, and about the unacceptability of anything less than a murder conviction, and talk about being ‘confrontational,’” said Judge Cahill. “I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that is disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch.”</p> <p id="riqQNs">Cahill denied the mistrial request, saying the jury had been told to avoid media coverage and he didn’t think jury members would be prejudiced about Waters’s comments. He also opined that “a congresswoman’s opinion really doesn’t matter a whole lot.” But he mused to Chauvin’s attorneys, “I’ll give you that Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned.” (On Tuesday afternoon, House Democrats blocked an attempt by Republicans to censure Waters, in a vote that broke down on party lines.)</p> <p id="44v3b9">Those on the right have exaggerated, distorted, and opportunistically spotlighted Waters’s remarks. She didn’t tell anyone to riot. However, the larger context here is that Waters has long believed, as have many on the left, that comfortable, privileged Americans are too willing to turn a blind eye to violence against Black people and other marginalized communities — and riots are, if not justified, at least an <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:XqijCZydxFYJ:https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-05-04-mn-1016-story.html+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">understandable</a> response.</p> <p id="5Bj505">Moderates and conservatives, meanwhile, have long argued that some on the left have been reluctant to fully condemn or work to prevent unrest that can result in death, injury, or financial ruin. This decades-old discourse was revived amid the unrest that followed Floyd’s killing in May 2020, and as the Chauvin verdict looms and cities fear new violent protests, it’s now back on the agenda.</p> <div id="DSYylP"><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/0LTj1q6Qs5uEhL3pJNaFa6" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></div> <h3 id="KSvCvB"></h3> <h3 id="4ymM3E">What Waters actually said</h3> <p id="ZBTYVL">While attending a Black Lives Matter protest in Minneapolis on Saturday night, Waters responded to questions about the unfolding trial. She repeatedly said protesters should “stay in the street” and “fight for justice.” She said she was looking for a guilty verdict for Chauvin — and for murder, not merely the lesser charge of manslaughter. Asked again what protesters should do, she <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/maxine-waters-more-confrontational/">said the following</a>:</p> <blockquote><p id="Tfrck9">Well, we’ve got to stay on the street. And we’ve got to get more active. We’ve got to get more confrontational. We’ve got to make sure that they know that we mean business.</p></blockquote> <p id="HUCM7m">Video of her remarks went viral, particularly among conservatives, who asserted Waters was urging protesters to riot if Chauvin was not convicted of murder. “Maxine Waters is inciting violence in Minneapolis,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy <a href="https://twitter.com/gopleader/status/1383944906637414406">tweeted</a>.</p> <p id="8bprko">The “incitement” accusation is vastly overstated. Waters didn’t address or direct a crowd in a speech, she spoke off the cuff to questioners, and her comments only went as viral as they did because conservatives made them viral.</p> <p id="Z6pDd4">While Waters made clear she wanted a guilty verdict, it’s not clear her advice for protesters was contingent on a “not guilty” verdict. One questioner used that framing, but Waters said she couldn’t hear him, and her eventual answer <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/maxine-waters-more-confrontational/">was in response to the broader question</a> of “What should protesters do?”</p> <p id="bvqunM">As for the accusation Waters encouraged violence or rioting, that hinges on her use of the phrase “get more confrontational.” In a <a href="https://thegrio.com/2021/04/19/maxine-waters-republicans-confrontational-comment/">subsequent interview with theGrio</a>, Waters said she was absolutely not endorsing violence, adding, “I am nonviolent.” When she used the word “confrontational,” she said she was referring to “confronting the justice system, confronting the policing that’s going on, I’m talking about speaking up.” Asked by <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1384291564986376197">CNN’s Manu Raju</a> if she stood by the word “confrontational,” Waters answered, “The whole civil rights movement is confrontational.”</p> <p id="NqCe8N">All of this will sound familiar because of President Donald Trump’s second impeachment trial, during which Democrats accused Trump of incitement of insurrection in part because he gave a speech with confrontational language, urging his supporters to “fight” just prior to their storming of the Capitol.</p> <p id="lTp0lH">To argue such language was common in politics, Trump’s defense attorneys pointed to examples of many Democrats, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/trump-defense-impeachment-political-vengeance">including Waters</a>, making similar comments. But Democrats argued that the speech was the culmination of Trump’s months-long, multipronged effort to overturn the results of a legitimate election. They fully admitted politicians often use the word “fight” in a rhetorical or metaphorical way.</p> <h3 id="ODwu99">The larger context</h3> <p id="swPfcK">The larger context here is that cities are “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cities+brace&amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS895US895&amp;oq=cities+brace+&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0i22i30l5j69i60l2.2367j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">bracing</a>” for large protests and possible violence if Chauvin gets acquitted, along the lines of the unrest that occurred in various cities after George Floyd’s killing last summer. <a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/08/10/fact-checking-claim-about-deaths-damage-from-black-lives-matter-protests/113878088/">About a dozen people</a> died during the unrest, in a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/27/21404117/kenosha-kyle-rittenhouse-police-gun-populism">mix</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/30/us/portland-shooting-explained.html">of</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/us/seattle-protests-CHOP-CHAZ-autonomous-zone.html">situations</a>, many more were injured, and there was over $1 billion in property damage <a href="https://www.axios.com/riots-cost-property-damage-276c9bcc-a455-4067-b06a-66f9db4cea9c.html">by one estimate</a>.</p> <p id="Oh79hg">Most politicians have tended to speak out against such violence, with many Democrats viewing it as obviously politically counterproductive to demonstrators’ aims (or, perhaps, to their own political fortunes). “Protesting such brutality is right and necessary. It’s an utterly American response,” Joe Biden <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1266949697874415618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1266949697874415618%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Fuk-factcheck-biden-condemn-violence-idUSKBN25V2O1">tweeted days after Floyd’s killing last May</a>. “But burning down communities and needless destruction is not. Violence that endangers lives is not.”</p> <p id="auoRqt">Many with further left views were conflicted over how to respond, though. There has been a strain of thinking on the left that <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/05/29/minneapolis-protest-martin-luther-king-quote-riot-george-floyd/5282486002/">riots motivated</a> by racial injustice are “the language of the unheard,” to quote Martin Luther King Jr. — and that understanding and sympathy, rather than condemnation, are called for. And Waters has long held this belief.</p> <p id="ipZCkI">In the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots of 1992 — riots that took place after police officers who badly beat a Black man, Rodney King, were acquitted, and in which <a href="https://spreadsheets.latimes.com/la-riots-deaths/">more than 60 people died</a> — then-freshman Rep. Waters <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:XqijCZydxFYJ:https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-05-04-mn-1016-story.html+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">specifically said</a> she was not going to tell people to “cool it,” adding, “The fact of the matter is, whether we like it or not, riot is the voice of the unheard.” (Later that year, she <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:MPU7avafQDkJ:https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-apr-29-op-wordwatch29-story.html+&amp;cd=12&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us">called the unrest</a> “not acceptable” but “understandable.”)</p> <p id="chqGAF">Waters’s core view that many in the US are too comfortably willing to excuse injustice against marginalized people, and that more aggressive protest tactics are often needed as a result, surfaced again in 2018. During the controversies over the Trump administration’s family separation policy, Waters again endorsed public (nonviolent) confrontation of Trump Cabinet officials, and a very similar cycle of controversy to the current one <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/25/17501450/maxine-waters-trump-pelosi-civility-sarah-sanders">ensued</a>.</p> <p id="GGCFXP">“If you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd, and you push back on them,” Waters <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/25/politics/maxine-waters-trump-officials">said at a rally</a> that year. “And you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere. We’ve got to get the children connected to their parents.”</p> <p id="ol5nah">The stakes in 2018 — about whether Trump officials could eat in DC restaurants without getting yelled at — were pretty low. But people can and do get killed and badly injured in riots, and property damage that big corporations can shrug off <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/business/small-business-insurance-unrest-kenosha.html">can ruin</a> small business owners. (In Los Angeles in 1992, for instance, Koreatown <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/28/us/la-riots-korean-americans/index.html">was hit hard</a>.)</p> <p id="WnHVtG">Conservatives argue that there has been a broad tendency on the left to downplay or excuse this behavior, without regard for its victims. Last summer, Trump’s team tried to associate the violence in cities with Democrats, as part of a strategy to blame the party for disorder more generally (including attacks on activists’ support of “defund the police”). Biden won, but some moderate Democrats concluded these attacks made the party underperform in Congress. And Republicans will doubtless hope to use a similar playbook in 2022, as Democrats’ narrow majorities in both houses of Congress hang in the balance.</p> <p id="XcaaJ0">Beyond the point about unrest, others have objected to Waters’s insistence that only one outcome in the trial — a guilty verdict of murder for Chauvin — is acceptable, saying that government officials should consider Chauvin innocent until proven guilty. The video of Floyd’s death has been publicly available since last year, and the trial arguments have been well-aired, so Waters can say she was expressing her opinion based on that.</p> <p id="kcVEap">But the criticism is that such statements from public officials in particular jeopardize the right to a fair trial and risk interfering with that trial — the latter of which is a criticism Democrats often made of Trump as he opined on his associates’ trials during his presidency.</p> <p id="SirEfs">And as for Judge Cahill’s hope that politicians would “stop talking” about what the verdict should be? President Joe Biden <a href="https://twitter.com/seungminkim/status/1384540682388393986?s=20">subsequently said Tuesday</a> that he was “praying” for “the right verdict” and that he thought the evidence was “overwhelming.”</p>

(In a past police report, officials noted that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/20/us/indianapolis-shooting-fedex-tuesday/index.html">he had visited white supremacist websites</a> in the past, though the FBI concluded after an interview that he did <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fedex-indianapolis-mass-shooting-e92ad3117c56357b3b2c71a2903e68a8">not ascribe to a racially motivated ideology</a>.)</p> <p id="laS65O">“Even if he had only visually scanned this facility before, there would be questions of targeting those he somehow thought to be different from him,” says Mallika Kaur, the acting executive director of the Sikh Family Center. “Anyone who does not enjoy the privilege of whiteness in this country would instantaneously think racism must be investigated as a motive.”</p> <p id="HJ8oCg"> Victims of the shooting — which also occurred amid a rise of anti-Asian sentiment during the pandemic — were Matthew Alexander, 32; Samaria Blackwell, 19; Amarjeet Johal, 66; Jasvinder Kaur, 50; Amarjit Sekhon, 48; Jaswinder Singh, 68; Karli Smith, 19; and John Weisert, 74.</p> <p id="5o4uV5">While data on hate crimes is still deeply flawed, <a href="https://www.sikhcoalition.org/press-release/200-percent-increase-anti-sikh-hate-crimes-reported-fbi-sikh-coalition-calls-action/">information gathered by the FBI</a> indicates that Sikh Americans are among the top targeted religious groups in the country in recent years, including as victims of fatal violence. In 2001, <a href="http://saldef.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Balbir_Singh_Sodhi_First_Backlash_Murder.pdf">gas station owner Balbir Singh Sodhi</a> was killed in Mesa, Arizona, by a shooter who espoused Islamophobic sentiments. And in 2012, a <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/oak-creek-massacre-5-yeras_n_59849e93e4b08b75dcc6ad70">white supremacist killed six people at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, Wisconsin</a>, a suburb of Milwaukee. </p> <p id="HzWPDg">For some, the Indianapolis shooting has made them recall these tragedies — and the feelings associated with them. </p> <p id="pmfAzc">Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh, chair of the religious studies department at Colby College, says it reminds her of the Milwaukee massacre that happened less than a decade ago, just four hours away. “It’s been very hard to process,” she said.</p> <p id="xhMFjp"><strong>“</strong>We are shook, again. And we are mortified, again,” adds Sikh Family Center’s Mallika Kaur.</p> <h3 id="vx0TbV">Sikh Americans have been the targets of xenophobia in the past </h3> <p id="xmx9Tm">Sikh Americans are a relatively small group in the US, numbering about 500,000 people total, with approximately 10,000 living in Indiana.</p> <p id="HjjY63">As far back as the early 1900s — <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/sikhs-in-america-hate-crime-victims-and-bias">since the brutal riots in Bellingham, Washington</a>, when white workers violently attacked Sikh men whom they viewed as competition for lumber mill jobs — Sikh Americans have faced xenophobia in the US. According to a <a href="https://saldef.org/national-sikh-survey-results/">2020 SALDEF poll</a>, 58 percent of Sikh Americans report being bullied or harassed because of their Sikh identity, while 63 percent of those who wear turbans say they’ve encountered bias because of it. </p> <p id="5h0YUm">The Sikh religion was established in South Asia, in a region that spans parts of Pakistan and India, and is founded on the premise of equality, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/sikhs-in-america-hate-crime-victims-and-bias">writes </a><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/17/opinions/indianapolis-shooting-sikh-singh/index.html">Simran Jeet Singh</a>, a Sikh Coalition fellow: </p> <blockquote><p id="rL9X4d">The faith’s founder, <a href="https://www.bl.uk/sacred-texts/articles/origins-and-development-of-sikh-faith-the-gurus">Guru Nanak</a>, was born in 1469 and was disenchanted with the suffering, divisions and social inequities he saw around him. He sought to establish a new community with a new vision rooted in oneness, love and justice. He taught that all people are equal and interconnected, and that human beings have no legitimate basis for creating hierarchies or discriminating against one another. Rather, each of us is inherently divine and we ought to treat one another accordingly. To serve humanity is to serve God (<a href="https://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/philosophy-spirituality-and-ethics/theology/vahiguru/">Vahiguru</a>).</p></blockquote> <p id="lpMc1N">As Singh explains, a longstanding Sikh tradition — the Langar — is a free communal meal that’s available to anyone, as long as it’s consumed “on the ground together as equals.” During the pandemic, Sikh temples, or Gurdwaras, have become major sources of food aid in several states, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/sikh-pandemic-food-support/index.html#:~:text=Worldwide%2C%20Sikh%20temples%2C%20also%20known,to%20the%20community%20at%20large.">CNN reports</a>.</p> <p id="C16yFO">Because of how government officials and the media have portrayed the United States’ conflict with terrorist groups, Sikh Americans, Muslim Americans, and South Asians have experienced virulent Islamophobia, especially since 9/11.<strong> </strong>As part of the Sikh tradition, practitioners may wear turbans and wear their hair and facial hair long, attributes that have been othered in the past or conflated with stereotypes about terrorists. Many Sikh Americans have had to navigate both anti-Asian sentiments, including the “forever foreigner” trope, and Islamophobia. </p> <p id="jJazl5">As Sikh Coalition’s Aasees Kaur told Vox, there is a “history of dehumanization” the group has been fighting for years. </p> <p id="uh1VgV">Because of such prejudices, members of the Sikh community have been subject to devastating acts of violence such as the 2012 shooting in Oak Creek, as well as <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/09/12/1914493/0/en/UNITED-SIKHS-RELEASE-TIMELINE-OF-ATTACKS-AGAINST-SIKHS-ACROSS-AMERICA-SINCE-SEPT-11-2001.html">a priest being punched</a> and told to go back to his own country in 2019, a cab driver being attacked by customers who <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/09/12/1914493/0/en/UNITED-SIKHS-RELEASE-TIMELINE-OF-ATTACKS-AGAINST-SIKHS-ACROSS-AMERICA-SINCE-SEPT-11-2001.html">called him Osama bin Laden</a> in 2010, and a man <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/man-accused-running-over-sikh-man-charged-hate-crime-n1234803">attempting to run over a Denver store owner</a> in 2020.</p> <p id="cnAo8S">“Nearly every family has a story of backlash,” says Kaur. </p> <h3 id="EUmWV3">Sikh Americans are grieving the recent shooting — and pushing for gun control </h3> <p id="OiZ67T">In the past week, Sikh Americans across the country have been holding candlelight vigils, virtual Kirtans, or music services, and prayer groups.</p> <p id="4lO7wZ">“The community is there to support not only the four Sikh victims, but all the victims,” says Kiran Kaur Gill, executive director of the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund. “In Sikhism, how we process grieving is we come together.” </p> <p id="guh9oe">Activists spoke, too, about the connections that community members have with the victims. “We’re seeing their images and we’re seeing our own grandparents and parents in them,” says Manpreet Kaur of the Jakara Movement. “It’s just incredible grief right now.”</p> <p id="8qd8vs"><a href="https://www.sikhcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.17.2021-SikhCoalition-Policy-Requests-IndianapolisShooting.pdf">The Sikh Coalition</a> is also among the groups calling for the passage of legislation that addresses current issues with hate crime tracking, as well as gun control. They’ve backed the Jabara-Heyer No Hate Act, which aims to improve the records that local law enforcement agencies keep of hate crimes, as well as the Disarm Hate Act, which would prohibit firearm sales to a person convicted of a misdemeanor hate crime. </p> <p id="alaZ2s">Colby College’s Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh also attributes violence toward marginalized groups, including Sikh Americans, to ignorance in the US, and emphasizes that educational curriculum in the country needs to be broadened as well. </p> <p id="26ImET">“There’s total ignorance about other cultures, so Sikhs have been targeted,” she says. “To know about Sikh tradition in schools and colleges, Sikh art, Sikh films, Sikh music — I want it to be promoted everywhere.”</p> <p id="QHb2Rz">Improving such understanding would allow people to better counter existing divisions and polarizing rhetoric by public officials, she says. </p> <p id="7PCjzf">“The basic principle of the Sikh tradition is one being,” Singh says. “We all belong to the same family.”</p>

Alexei Navalny, the Russian dissident on hunger strike, explained
</title>
<content type="html">

The hunger strike has kept the pro-democracy leader in the headlines.</p> <p id="EAzuL8">The greatest challenger to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rule is a man whose name the dictator won’t say and whom he has tried to kill: Alexei Navalny. </p> <p id="YjcQJf">Having <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/17/22235971/alexei-navalny-russia-detained-moscow-putin">defiantly returned to Russia</a> after surviving a brazen assassination attempt only to be immediately detained and thrown in jail upon arrival, the opposition leader and anti-corruption crusader has rallied tens of thousands of supporters to his cause like never before — a real sign of trouble for Putin’s hold on power.</p> <p id="mROTDq"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/12/30/7468609/alexei-navalny-russia">Alexei Navalny</a> has spent over a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/timeline-attacks-alexei-navalny-vladimir-putin-biggest-critic-russia-poison-1526386">decade</a> trying to overthrow Putin. Through slick videos, public mobilization, and even an ill-fated <a href="https://2018.navalny.com/en/platform/">presidential run</a> against the autocrat, Navalny has aimed to expose Kremlin corruption and malfeasance. </p> <p id="w3DH72">While Navalny’s ultimate goal seems to be to take Putin’s place, not just depose him, few believe he will actually succeed. Still, his campaign has inspired tens of thousands across the country to take to the streets to express their frustration with the regime — <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/navalny-protests-threaten-to-snowball-as-grievances-grow-in-russia-11611667251">many for the first time</a> — posing an <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/7/2/21311144/putin-russia-vote-president-2036">existential threat to Putin</a>. </p> <p id="iyzuzX">The problem for the president is, try as he might, he can’t keep the 44-year-old dissident quiet. </p> <p id="X6eBWY">Last year, Kremlin operatives tried to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/21/21395670/russia-alexei-navalny-vladimir-putin-poison-novichok">assassinate</a> the opposition leader with a highly toxic nerve agent planted in his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/21/europe/russia-navalny-poisoning-underpants-ward/index.html">underwear</a>, a bold operation that most experts say likely would have required Putin’s approval to launch. </p> <p id="O00DiW">Navalny lived, but he spent five months recuperating from a coma in Germany. Yet despite being threatened with immediate arrest upon arrival back in Russia, he vowed to return to his homeland to continue the fight against Putin. Navalny met that fate on <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/17/22235971/alexei-navalny-russia-detained-moscow-putin">January 17</a> shortly after his flight from Berlin landed in Moscow, and he’s now <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russian-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-faced-court-hearing-police-station-n1254569">imprisoned for at least 2.5 years</a>. </p> <p id="SVKEbc">But even that attempt to silence Navalny hasn’t worked so far: Navalny has remained in the headlines even while in custody. </p> <p id="6bH0k9">Navalny has been on a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/kremlin-critic-alexei-navalny-begins-hunger-strike-in-new-standoff-with-authorities-11617217340?mod=article_inline">hunger strike for three weeks</a>, protesting the lack of medical care he says he’s had while in prison, and his lawyers have continued to publicize his plight throughout his ordeal. </p> <p id="128jyB">But his condition has gotten so bad that not even Russian authorities can ignore it. They <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/alexei-navalny-hospitalized-in-russia-three-weeks-into-hunger-strike-11618839052">transferred Navalny to a hospital on Monday</a> for treatment, though it’s unclear if he will get the quality of care he needs. Navalny’s aides are so concerned that they say the pro-democracy leader is on death’s door.</p> <p id="gF2k6Y">“Alexei is dying ... it’s a question of days,” Navalny’s spokesperson, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/alexei-navalny-near-death-poisoning-russian-prison_n_607b9aafe4b001abc4dd1929">Kira Yarmysh</a>, said on Facebook this week.</p> <p id="HzXHk0">Navalny’s fate is now a serious matter of international concern, with US national security adviser Jake Sullivan recently promising “<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/18/russia-navalny-dies-sullivan-482837">there will be consequences</a>” if the Putin opponent dies in prison.</p> <p id="JylSgb">Putin is now on the defensive. He’s receiving calls from <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/26/22250858/biden-putin-call-election-ukraine-navalny-bounties-solarwinds">President Joe Biden</a> and <a href="https://www.state.gov/g7-foreign-ministers-statement-on-arrest-and-detention-of-alexey-navalny/#:~:text=Russia%20is%20bound%20by%20its,a%20substance%20developed%20by%20Russia.">other leaders</a> to release Navalny, even as Russian authorities round up members of the <a href="https://twitter.com/RobynDixon__/status/1354537112046067715?s=20">dissident’s team</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/alexei-navalny-offices-raided-b0a59181c1c715513159b5d479e2b0c5">family</a>. He’s also under pressure at home from Russians who support Navalny.</p> <p id="BUBoSY">“Putin was an untouchable, a god above everything else. But that’s no longer the case,” Maria Snegovaya, an expert on Russian politics at George Washington University, told me. </p> <div id="2yxGqw"><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/3WkmZLVY5055rFgonJ4FcB" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></div> <h3 id="5f32n8">Putin broke an implicit promise to Russians. Activists pounced.</h3> <p id="DCfQlT">Little initially bothered Putin after he became president for the first time in 2000. The <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/08/19/long-read-russias-economy-under-putin-in-numbers-a66924">economy doubled and living standards rose</a> during his first decade in charge, muting critiques from dissidents of the regime’s repression of free speech and civil rights. </p> <p id="pyFao6">Experts say Russians implicitly understood there was a grand bargain: If Putin could keep the money flowing and not act in an openly corrupt way, then the citizenry would abide by his iron-fisted leadership.</p> <p id="KIpwsF">But two events in 2011 ended the fragile deal. </p> <p id="2KRL35">First, Putin that September <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/world/europe/medvedev-says-putin-will-seek-russian-presidency-in-2012.html">announced he would reassume the presidency</a> after serving one term as Russia’s prime minister, the No. 2 role. Simply put, Putin was still in charge of the country, but he accepted a technically inferior position to keep up democratic appearances. The president, Dmitri Medvedev, was viewed as little more than <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-puppet-president-medvedev-s-betrayal-of-russian-democracy-a-789767.html">a puppet</a>. </p> <p id="Tun3JE">By effectively stating “I will be president again” — without giving Russians any real say in the matter — Putin defied the unspoken “don’t be openly corrupt” rule.</p> <p id="DRE866">Second, Putin’s party, United Russia, got caught <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/eu-court-putins-party-rigged-the-2011-russian-elections-2017-6">rigging the December 2011 legislative elections</a>. Fraud in Russian elections was normal, and there wasn’t more than usual during that particular vote, “but examples of fraud were spread quickly on the internet for the first time,” said Timothy Frye, a Columbia University professor and author of the forthcoming <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691212463/weak-strongman"><em>Weak Strongman: The Limits of Power in Putin’s Russia</em></a>. </p> <p id="5mHKsL">That provided ammunition to a growing cadre of opposition activists looking for a catalyzing cause — Alexei Navalny among them. </p> <h3 id="ZSTtcW">Who is Alexei Navalny?</h3> <p id="68uUcf">Navalny, who grew up about 60 miles southwest of Moscow, made his name in 2008 as a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-16057045">blogger</a>. His earliest posts centered on corruption at state-owned companies, and sometimes he’d get extraordinary access by becoming a minority shareholder in the company in order to ask probing questions.</p> <p id="H02G11">His readership grew, and his platform turned him into one of the main leaders of the 2011 protests in Moscow. Featuring roughly <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-16122524">50,000 people</a>, they were the biggest in the capital city since the fall of the Soviet Union. </p> <p id="OlLz6I">“I’d like to thank Alexei Navalny,” a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/10/world/europe/the-saturday-profile-blogger-aleksei-navalny-rouses-russia.html">young activist shouted</a> in a room of organizers the day before demonstrations began. “Thanks to him, specifically because of the efforts of this concrete person, tomorrow thousands of people will come out to the square. It was he who united us with the idea: all against ‘the Party of Swindlers and Thieves.’” </p> <p id="cqrDGr">Navalny rode that wave of popularity to a run for Moscow’s mayor in 2013. It’s more than a prestigious municipal job; whoever runs the capital is viewed by many in Russia as a future top federal official. To win the election, then, would mean more than just getting to lead a global city. It’d mean Navalny was clawing his way into Russia’s inner circle of power.</p> <p id="RVtX4B">Navalny ran on an unapologetically <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/07/is-aleksei-navalny-a-liberal-or-a-nationalist/278186/">nationalist platform</a>, most notably calling for restrictive immigration policies to keep Muslims from the Caucasus and Central Asia out of the country and supporting Russia’s 2008 war in Georgia. Duke University’s Irina Soboleva told me that the candidate’s hardline stances during the campaign alienated members of Navalny’s young, urban base.</p> <figure class="e-image"> <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i93xfdJ4RooiMzJKZXSSoCXGDTM=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268783/1204118476.jpg"> <cite>Sergei Fadeichev/TASS via Getty Images</cite> <figcaption>Alexei Navalny takes part in an opposition rally on February 29, 2020, in Moscow.</figcaption> </figure> <p id="Ga7HKU">“I consider Aleksei Navalny the most dangerous man in Russia,” <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/07/is-aleksei-navalny-a-liberal-or-a-nationalist/278186/">Engelina Tareyeva</a>, who worked with Navalny in a Russian liberal party until he was expelled from it in 2007, wrote of him. “You don’t have to be a genius to understand that the most horrific thing that could happen in our country would be the nationalists coming to power.”</p> <p id="ya7jdc">Navalny didn’t win the mayoral race, finishing second with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/kremlin-critic-alexei-navalny-has-strong-showing-in-moscow-mayoral-race-despite-loss/2013/09/09/dc9504e4-1924-11e3-a628-7e6dde8f889d_story.html">27 percent of the vote</a> behind incumbent and Putin ally Sergei Sobyanin, who won with over half the votes (four other candidates split the remaining count). But Navalny’s strong showing — despite very long odds — gave him the legitimacy and standing to seek more power.</p> <p id="SNuVmg">“His ambitions were greater than just being the leader of the urban middle class,” Soboleva said.</p> <h3 id="eGsUB5">Putin regained popularity. Navalny organized against him.</h3> <p id="3Wcbkc">In 2014, Putin sent forces to invade the southern Ukrainian peninsula of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/9/3/18088560/ukraine-everything-you-need-to-know">Crimea</a>. He then annexed the territory because he wanted it returned to Russia’s fold and because Kyiv was on the verge of an economic pact with the European Union. For Putin, such a deal meant Ukraine — long in Russia’s sphere of influence — was tilting away from Moscow. The incursion, then, was both punishment and raw geopolitics.</p> <p id="k2uGxF">But there was an added benefit for the autocrat: Russians celebrated the risky invasion. They rewarded Putin with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/2015/jul/23/vladimir-putins-approval-rating-at-record-levels">record approval ratings</a>, numbers he desperately needed to muddle through a brutal <a href="https://meduza.io/en/slides/five-years-later-russia-still-hasn-t-recovered-from-its-2014-economic-crisis-these-graphs-explain-why">economic downturn wracking his country</a>. </p> <p id="Mi1W9K">“Crimea bought the regime four years of wiggle room,” Columbia’s Frye told me.</p> <p id="lUD65B">That period was mostly a quiet one for Russia’s opposition. Just like in the 2000s, it was hard to find a receptive audience for the anti-Putin cause when most people were happy with the leader.</p> <p id="hr8VqX">Navalny, then, used the lull to organize against his chief rival. Part of his animus turned personal after <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/timeline-attacks-alexei-navalny-vladimir-putin-biggest-critic-russia-poison-1526386">Russian law enforcement charged him in 2013 and 2014</a> with embezzlement, which most experts say was meant to discredit him. After the second charge, Navalny was placed under <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/28/alexei-navalny-russia-opposition-leader-house-arrest">house arrest</a> and only given permission to speak with his family.</p> <p id="zZMy5a">But the opposition leader wasn’t discouraged. Instead, experts told me he developed a three-pronged strategy to prepare for whenever Putin was vulnerable again.</p> <p id="PACQHT">The first part was straightforward: He had to make his politics more appealing to a wider Russian audience. The Islamophobia and hardline nationalism might garner support from ethnic Russians, but certainly not the masses. Without disavowing his previous views, Navalny zeroed in on one core message: corruption. </p> <p id="DY3AX2">“It was a sound political strategy,” said Angela Stent, who directs the Center for Eurasian, Russian, and East European studies at Georgetown University. After all, Russia was (and remains) <a href="https://www.transparency.org/en/countries/russia#">one of the world’s most corrupt</a> countries, and the problems this corruption has wrought have impacted nearly every Russian’s life. No other issue, the thinking went, would be as universally understood and enraging.</p> <p id="jaZ1jF">Getting his message out there would be difficult, though, as the Kremlin held a tight grip over the media. To get around that problem, Navalny made building a large social media presence the second pillar of his plan. “He saw the political utility of YouTube before other opposition leaders,” said George Washington University’s Snegovaya.</p> <p id="Ub8yTP">The opposition leader has posted video after embarrassing video exposing the corruption of Russia’s elites on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsAw3WynQJMm7tMy093y37A">YouTube channel</a>, which today has 6.25 million subscribers. One particularly famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrwlk7_GF9g">upload</a> from 2017 alleged that former President Medvedev took <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/russian-opposition-politician-navalny-links-pm-medvedev-to-billion-euro-property-empire/a-37787539">bribes from oligarchs</a> disguised as charitable donations, a charge he denies. </p> <p id="B5FgIa">When the Russian government succeeds in blocking access to the exposés, Navalny and his team place the videos elsewhere — including on <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/6/2/15726082/russia-putin-navalny-pornhub">pornography sites</a> — so anyone can see them.</p> <figure class="e-image"> <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HUr4gXpgPvrbnjaHml4YyFrrICE=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268786/1230173378.jpg"> <cite>Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images</cite> <figcaption>Russian President Vladimir Putin seen speaking on the screen during his annual press conference, on December 17, 2020, in Moscow.</figcaption> </figure> <p id="QMD6lE">The success of his YouTube channel bolstered Navalny’s reputation as an anti-corruption crusader, and his audience grew. “He sensed that corruption would be accessible enough to build a large following on the internet,” Snegovaya noted.</p> <p id="UZogdf">That allowed him to undertake the third part of his strategy: forming a national network of opposition politicians. Instead of focusing all of his efforts in major cities like Moscow, Navalny opened offices around the country to help local politicians defeat members of Putin’s United Russia party. Providing candidates with financing and know-how, Navalny’s team has helped dissidents <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-regional-elections-bring-rare-win-for-alexei-navalny-kremlin-opposition/">take power away from Putin cronies in regional elections</a> across the country.</p> <p id="mnHFgK">“There’s no opposition figure in Russia that has the network that Navalny does,” said Columbia’s Frye.</p> <p id="CPbBqC">The main goal, of course, was to weaken the president’s party nationwide. But experts told me the side effect — Russians suddenly being able to see politicians without ties to Putin actually working in citizens’ interests — was equally important for Navalny’s movement.</p> <h3 id="ZMQOpE">Putin fought back. Navalny withstood the onslaught.</h3> <p id="6acGMC">Navalny didn’t get to do all of that without pushback, especially after he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/world/europe/aleksei-navalny-putin-president-russia.html">announced in 2016 that he would run for president</a> in two years. </p> <p id="WWZRVr">In 2017, the opposition leader was attacked with an antiseptic known as “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39735867">brilliant green</a>” outside his Moscow office, covering half of his face in what looked like paint. “It looks funny but it hurts like hell,” he tweeted at the time, adding that he lost 80 percent of the vision in his right eye. </p> <p id="4VuLUx">Reports later confirmed he suffered a <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/society/27/04/2017/590220cf9a79471de4efba99">chemical burn</a>. It’s still unclear who was responsible, but Navalny, unsurprisingly, blamed the Kremlin.</p> <p id="2U33TE">Later that year, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/25/573394432/russian-opposition-leader-barred-from-running-against-putin-in-2018">12 of Russia’s 13 election commissioners voted to bar Navalny</a> from standing against Putin in the presidential race, citing his embezzlement charges from years prior. Navalny was never likely to win — the vote was already rigged in Putin’s favor, and reliable polls showed the dissident failed to attract much support — but the decision once again ended the pretense of a functioning democracy in Russia.</p> <p id="rSX3tK">The government’s interest in Navalny didn’t end there. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/world/europe/aleksei-navalny-arrested.html">Moscow’s police force detained him </a>in the summer of 2019 for planning what authorities said was an unauthorized protest. While in jail, he suffered a severe skin reaction that required him to seek medical attention at a hospital. He went back behind bars after his recovery, but he <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/kremlin-critic-alexei-navalny-says-he-was-poisoned-in-custody/a-49856462">claimed the skin reaction was the result of having been poisoned</a>.</p> <p id="ZtauHr">The increased harassment made clear that Navalny was a prime Putin target. The worst, though, was yet to come.</p> <h3 id="vfMaIv">Putin got scared. Navalny paid the price.</h3> <p id="F0wXsa"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/08/20/who-is-alexei-navalny-kremlin-critic-coma-after-suspected-poisoning/">Navalny</a> boarded a flight from Siberia to Moscow last August. He became ill on the aircraft; a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/alexei-navalny-video-putin-critic-screaming">video</a> shows him moaning and needing immediate medical attention.</p> <p id="gUjOz0">The plane made an emergency landing in Omsk, near Kazakhstan, where an <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/navalny-poisoning-russian-opposition-leader-hospitalized/2020/08/20/290fbd58-e29c-11ea-82d8-5e55d47e90ca_story.html">ambulance</a> waited to take him to a local hospital. But Navalny’s condition worsened, and he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/navalny-poisoning-russian-opposition-leader-hospitalized/2020/08/20/290fbd58-e29c-11ea-82d8-5e55d47e90ca_story.html">fell into a coma</a> before he arrived at the facility.</p> <p id="FeNxk0">Russia’s Omsk Emergency Hospital No. 1, where Navalny was first treated, became the site of a frustrating standoff between Navalny’s family and supporters and the doctors overseeing his care. Navalny’s wife, Yulia Navalnaya, and team alleged the doctors were controlled by the Kremlin and tried to cover up the poisoning attack instead of properly treating their patient.</p> <p id="AYuPqT">The physicians at the time said Navalny wasn’t poisoned but instead suffered from a “<a href="https://apple.news/AH_0SsNyrT7O4rwNCzeoUtw">metabolic disorder</a>” that led to <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/doctors-ban-navalny-being-transported-abroad-amid-claim-of-kremlin-pressure-12053503">low blood sugar</a>. “Poisons or traces of their presence in the body have not been identified,” <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/21/europe/alexey-navalny-russia-travel-intl/index.html">Anatoly Kalinichenko</a>, the deputy chief doctor at the Omsk emergency hospital, told reporters at the time. “The diagnosis of ‘poisoning’ remains somewhere in the back of our minds, but we do not believe that the patient suffered poisoning.”</p> <p id="kvveDX">But Navalny’s team — including Navalnaya, who was <a href="https://twitter.com/Kira_Yarmysh/status/1296785890291875842?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1296785890291875842%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dw.com%2Fen%2Falexei-navalny-poisoning-omsk-berlin%2Fa-54645234">barred from seeing her husband in the hospital</a> — suspected foul play. They had good reason to believe that: The Kremlin has a <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/08/01/why-russia-keeps-poisoning-people-navalny-suspected-illness-protests-moscow/">long, sordid history of poisoning</a> political dissidents, defectors, and other enemies of the state.</p> <p id="5eu1Uc">“The medics are being totally commanded by the FSB and hardly release anything,” Vladimir Milov, a close Navalny associate, told me while Navalny was in the Russian hospital, using the acronym for Russia’s Federal Security Service, the successor agency to the Soviet-era KGB responsible for internal security.</p> <p id="eJtCpd">“We of course cannot trust this hospital and we demand for Alexei to be given to us, so that we could have him treated in an independent hospital whose doctors we trust,” <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/21/europe/alexey-navalny-russia-travel-intl/index.html">Navalnaya</a> said in another press conference on August 21.</p> <figure class="e-image"> <img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AgKZLK4PBCmDwTlQNfTQRFoHoV4=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268791/1228118194.jpg"> <cite>Yelena Latypova/AFP via Getty Images</cite> <figcaption>A picture taken on August 20, 2020, shows a general view of Omsk Emergency Hospital No. 1, where Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was admitted.</figcaption> </figure> <p id="7vpULp">A medical plane sent by the Berlin-based humanitarian group <a href="https://www.cinemaforpeace-foundation.org/">Cinema for Peace Foundation</a> later arrived in Omsk to take Navalny to Germany for treatment. The Russian doctors initially <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/world/europe/russia-navalny-poison-hospital.html">blocked the transfer</a>, saying Navalny wasn’t stable enough to travel, before finally <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/alexei-navalny-poisoning-omsk-berlin/a-54645234">allowing the German physicians to take a look at the patient’s condition</a>.</p> <p id="961v5F">Luckily, doctors in Berlin successfully treated Navalny, leading to his release from the hospital on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/world/europe/aleksei-navalny-hospital-release.html">September 23</a> after a full recovery. </p> <p id="hKoff9">The next month, the <a href="https://www.opcw.org/media-centre/news/2020/10/opcw-issues-report-technical-assistance-requested-germany">Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons</a> — the world’s top chemical weapons watchdog — concluded that Navalny had been poisoned with Novichok, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6039123/">a highly lethal nerve agent</a>. It was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43377698">developed by the Soviet Union</a>, leading many to conclude that the Kremlin was behind the attack on its longtime adversary.</p> <p id="0YV6Ne">Navalny confirmed that himself while he remained in Germany. Working with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/21/europe/russia-navalny-poisoning-underpants-ward/index.html">CNN</a> last December, Navalny tricked a Russian agent — part of an elite FSB toxin team that had trailed him for three years — to reveal secret aspects of the operation to kill him. The operative, Konstantin Kudryavtsev, told Navalny during a phone call that Novichok had been placed on “the insides, the crotch” of the dissident’s underpants. </p> <p id="Vdo3Vw">When asked about the Kremlin’s involvement in the assassination attempt, Putin denied it, claiming instead that Navalny was getting help from US intelligence services to make a big fuss out of nothing. If Russian agents had really wanted to finish the job of killing Navalny, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/17/europe/putin-annual-press-conference-intl/index.html">Putin</a> told reporters during his annual press conference in December, “they would’ve probably finished it.”</p> <p id="1LGDpm">There are no concrete answers as to why the regime would want Navalny dead now after all this time, but experts have two main theories.</p> <p id="DnFH5o">The first is that United Russia’s supermajority in the nation’s legislature — the Duma — is under threat in <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/01/05/russia-in-2021-looming-elections-dominate-the-domestic-scene-a72391">September’s elections</a>. Navalny’s organizing and Putin’s unpopularity due to a flatlining economy and worsening pandemic could lead some Putin-allied lawmakers to lose. If that’s the case, Putin would no longer be able to ram whatever he wants through the governing body.</p> <p id="PI5SRT">Putin could try to rig the election, of course, but George Washington University’s Snegovaya told me that “it’s impossible to rig the election completely.” Fewer people actually support the president right now, she said, and international observers watch the vote closely. The dictator’s brutal calculation therefore might have been that killing Navalny would hurt the opposition’s chances ahead of the crucial election.</p> <p id="TgSIMk">The other possibility experts floated was that Putin is worried about the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/10/21357805/belarus-election-tikhanovskaya-lukashenko-protest-minsk">revolution in neighboring Belarus</a>. A strong opposition formed against Alexander Lukashenko, Europe’s longest-serving dictator and a staunch Putin ally, and revolts started last year after an election many believe he rigged. Demonstrations haven’t stopped, and Putin, who is notoriously concerned about being toppled in a revolution, might fear a similar phenomenon in his country.</p> <p id="sJFUEN">“Putin definitely follows what’s going on in Belarus closely, and he takes what’s happening very personally,” Duke’s Soboleva told me. Putin might be thinking “if you don’t eliminate your political opponents and rivals early, they might be a big problem for you later,” she said.</p> <p id="oGEtPC">But instead of eliminating Navalny, Putin made him stronger.</p> <h3 id="wFTij3">Putin tried to silence his rival. Navalny just gained a larger audience.</h3> <p id="rHcRdn">After Navalny recovered from the poisoning, the Kremlin did everything possible to try to dissuade him from returning to Russia.</p> <p id="0xJPxH">Late last year, <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/01/14/navalny-added-to-russias-wanted-list-a72605">the Kremlin placed him on the government’s federal wanted list</a>, claiming he avoided Russian federal authorities while abroad. As part of a probation sentence from the 2014 embezzlement case, Navalny had to check in with inspectors regularly — but that’s hard to do while you’re in a coma.</p> <p id="467rDR">Even with the threat of arrest hanging over him, Navalny flew to Moscow on January 17 while downplaying widespread fears that he’d be detained upon arrival. “<a href="https://twitter.com/dwnews/status/1350845363922608129?s=20">It’s impossible</a>,” he <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-returns-to-moscow-11610906483">told people</a> aboard his flight. “I feel like a citizen of Russia who has every right to return to my home.”</p> <p id="uSXWPK">But, of course, it proved completely possible: <a href="https://twitter.com/Kirilenko_a/status/1350866189774417921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1350866189774417921%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc">Video</a> showed an official approaching Navalny at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport near passport control. Navalny then kissed his wife, Yulia, before going with the official and other guards. He’s been held by the <a href="https://twitter.com/antontroian/status/1350870678061408256?s=20">federal prison service</a> ever since as he awaits his <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russian-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-faced-court-hearing-police-station-n1254569">February trial</a>.</p> <div id="2xTXyV"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"> <p lang="ru" dir="ltr">Видео задержания Навального <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B2%D0%B0?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#москва</a> <a href="https://t.co/HgPLJKfKym">pic.twitter.com/HgPLJKfKym</a></p>— Алексей Кириленко (@Kirilenko_a) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kirilenko_a/status/1350866189774417921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2021</a> </blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </div> <p id="Cscjbd">But Navalny and his team have fought back. They released the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipAnwilMncI">Putin Palace</a>” video — alleging that the Russian leader has used bribe money to build an estate on land 39 times larger than the principality of Monaco — which had the <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/vladimir-putin-palace-in-navalny-report-doesnt-belong-to-me/a-56335181">president answering questions</a> raised by the man he wants silenced. </p> <p id="SYVpJy">“Nothing that is listed there as my property belongs to me or my close relatives, and never did,” Putin said during a video call at the time, as always refusing to say Navalny’s name. But many people didn’t buy his denial. </p> <p id="ZwyikB">Russians erupted in protest after the video’s release and Navalny’s detention. The nation’s citizens, suffering an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/business/russia-economic-growth.html">economic downturn</a> and an <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/4/6/21200167/coronavirus-russia-vladimir-putin-moscow-cases">unrelenting coronavirus outbreak</a>, occupied the streets of more than <a href="https://time.com/5933718/alexey-navalny-putin-protests/">100 Russian cities</a> on <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/23/22246273/russian-protesters-arrested-alexei-navalny-demonstrations-putin-critic">January 23</a>, some braving temperatures as low as <a href="https://time.com/5933718/alexey-navalny-putin-protests/">minus 60 degrees Fahrenheit</a>.
